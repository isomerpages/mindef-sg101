#### Beyond self-interest
For there to be peace and progress in a multi-racial, multi-religious and multi-cultural society like ours, Singaporeans need to go beyond our self-interest. We need to look out for one another, respect each other, and to live in harmony together. Singaporeans need to care for the young, the old, and the ones with disabilities. It means forming a just, equal and inclusive society where everyone, regardless of background, can seek opportunities for a better life. Our strong economic growth and good urban environment would be meaningless if we faced constant conflicts and disorder in society.

#### Beware of fault lines
We are a diverse people with different views, interests and instincts. We will always be at risk of clashing along old and new fault lines, facing challenges from internal and external influences. Our harmonious state of affairs can never be taken for granted. It is a continuous work in progress.

#### Be responsible citizens
Singapore was created through our own self-determination. As stakeholders of our nation, we are all responsible for the future of our country. We need to act as a cohesive society with a strong sense of citizenry, always finding the balance to serve the greater good.
