### 13 April 2002: Introduction of the EZ-Link card

Taking the bus used to be such a hassle. You would need to know how much it costs to get to your destination, and then count out the coins. It's even worse when a queue forms behind you as you struggle to dig out the last cent, and then oh no – the coins are dropping. Even with farecards, there was only so long you could stare at the various fare buttons on the machine in puzzlement.

It was on this day on 13 April 2002, that we could finally give up the coins, farecards, and confusion. Just a tap and beep, we were in. All we had to scramble for were seats on the bus. And then, with another tap, we were out, with the correct fare paid.

The idea of EZ-Link had been long in the making, and was mooted in 1994. After many trials, it was released to the public #onthisday. It soon expanded beyond being used for public transport, and into a payment mode accepted at many places such as retail shops, cinemas, and schools. 

EZ-Link cards made our lives easier and more convenient. Yet, we don’t stop, and keep finding more ways to improve. We are looking at new versions of the EZ-Link card to allow top-ups on the go by using our phones. No more going to the nearest top-up machine for that. The EZ-link card is small but efficient, and never stops improving.
