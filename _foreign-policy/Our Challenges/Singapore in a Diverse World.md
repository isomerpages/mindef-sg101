When Singapore was separated from Malaysia and thrust into independence in 1965, our main preoccupation was survival. Our security and foreign policy concerns were compounded by regional and international developments, as well as domestic unrest.

The geopolitical landscape in Southeast Asia was fraught with uncertainty. Surrounded by bigger and more powerful neighbours, we were a small country located in a diverse region where big power conflicts took place.[\[1\]](#_ftn1)

In 1965, the Cold War was at its height, and in the region, the Vietnam War had been raging on for several years. The Union of Soviet Socialist Republics (Soviet Union) and Maoist China sought to extend their communist influence over Southeast Asia, including in Singapore. Between 1963 and 1966, Indonesia, led by then-President Soekarno, initiated *Konfrontasi* (Confrontation) against Singapore, Malaya, Sarawak, Brunei and North Borneo as a protest against the formation of the Federation of Malaysia.

Singapore in the 1950s and 1960s was a turbulent society. There were unrests initiated by trade unions and student groups influenced by political ideology such as the Malayan Communist Party (MCP). In 1964, there were a series of racial riots amidst _Konfrontasi_ and tensions between Singapore, then still a state within Malaysia, and the federal authorities in Kuala Lumpur.

Against this backdrop, it was important for Singapore to gain recognition for its independence and sovereignty from as many countries as possible.[\[2\]](#_ftn2) Shortly after gaining our independence on 9 August 1965, Singapore applied to join the United Nations on 3 September 1965. On 20 September 1965, a resolution recommending that the General Assembly admit Singapore into the UN was put to a vote in the Security Council. There was unanimous support and Singapore became the 117th UN member state on 21 September 1965.

In his statement upon Singapore’s admission to the UN, then-Minister for Foreign Affairs Mr S Rajaratnam outlined guiding principles of Singapore’s foreign policy which are still relevant today.[\[3\]](#_ftn3)
