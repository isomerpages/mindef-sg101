<p>As a small island-nation surrounded by large neighbours in a culturally
diverse region, Singapore aims to make as many friends as we can while
insisting that we be treated as a sovereign equal, where our national interests
are not subservient to others.</p>
<p>In the pursuit of our national interests, we will also have to be mindful
of the national interests of our partners and friends, and work together
to find solutions to global challenges, because no country, large or small,
can succeed on its own.[^1] However, there will also be times when our
interests on issues diverge, including with bigger powers.</p>
<p>Where possible, we try to find a mutually beneficial approach to resolve
issues. But when key national interests are at stake, we stand firm on
our position even if we come under heavy pressure, or if it means a temporary
downturn in bilateral relations.<a href="*Ibid.*" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">^2</a> We do not shy away from standing up for the principles
that are fundamental to our survival as an independent, sovereign nation.
Otherwise, Singapore’s right to survive and prosper may be called into
question one day.</p>
<p>Since our independence, Singapore has encountered issues that challenged
the principles fundamental to our sovereignty and national interests. Each
time, we stood firm, and adopted a principled stand in accordance with
our national interests. We act consistently according to our principles
that are in the long-term interests of Singapore, and do not take sides
or succumb to external pressures.</p>
<p>Ultimately, our foreign policy serves to safeguard Singapore’s national
interests and Singaporeans’ freedom to chart our own destiny. As a small
country, some countries may try to pressure Singapore to take their side.
Hence, we need to uphold an inclusive and rules-based multilateral system,
which gives small states a collective stake and voice, and resists a “might
is right” paradigm.</p>
<p>The multilateral system is governed by the international rule of law and
norms, including those under the United Nations Charter. This allows states
to interact and cooperate with one another on an equal footing, regardless
of size.[^3] Under this system, all countries have sovereign equality and
disputes can be settled peacefully in accordance with international law.
Respect for international law will bring about global peace and stability.</p>

<p><strong>The International Rule of Law</strong>
</p>
<p>Singapore is a staunch supporter of international law and the principles
enshrined in the United Nations Charter. Member countries must abide by
the purposes and principles of the United Nations. This includes upholding
the sovereign equality of states; respecting their territorial integrity
and political independence; and upholding the resolution of disputes by
peaceful means.[^4]</p>

</div>
<p>Within the region, we need to continue to build strong relationships and
deepen our cooperation, both bilaterally and as a region. This can help
to strengthen our influence as a group, enhance our regional security and
our shared prosperity. When countries have more stake in one another’s
success and greater inter-dependence, they have a greater incentive to
uphold a collaborative and peaceful world order.[^5]</p>
<p>Beyond the region, we will continue to build a strong network of like-minded
international partners, and be a responsible and constructive global player
by supporting and actively participating in international organisations
such as the United Nations.</p>

<h4>Examples and Case Studies Related to Upholding Our Sovereignty</h4>
<p><strong>MacDonald House Bombing</strong>
</p>
<p>On 10 March 1965, as part of Indonesia’s <em>Konfrontasi</em>, two saboteurs,
who were Indonesian marines, bombed MacDonald House in Singapore, killing
three and injuring 33 people. <em>Konfrontasi</em> ended in August 1966 when
Indonesia signed a peace treaty with Malaysia. In September 1967, Singapore
established formal diplomatic ties with Indonesia. However, bilateral relations
were strained once again when Singapore sentenced the saboteurs to death.
They were hanged in 1968, despite pleas for clemency from then-Indonesian
President Soeharto. This caused a lot of public anger in Indonesia and
protestors ransacked the Singapore Embassy in Jakarta.[^6]</p>

<p>During then-Prime Minister Mr Lee Kuan Yew’s first visit to Indonesia
in May 1973, he scattered flower petals on the graves of the two marines.
Mr Lee’s gesture of goodwill provided some closure to the matter and relations
between the two countries improved thereafter.[^7]</p>

<p>In 2014, Indonesia named a new warship “Usman Harun” after the two marines
who carried out the 1965 MacDonald House bombing in Singapore. The naming
of the ship by Indonesia, and Singapore’s objections to it, led to much
unhappiness on both sides, setting back our relations momentarily[^8].</p>
<div class="isomer-image-wrapper">
<img style="width: 100%" height="auto" width="100%" alt="" src="/images/shanmugam%20speech%20feb%202014.png">
</div>
<p>Singapore strongly registered our concerns on the naming of the ship with
Indonesia. The commander-in-chief of the Indonesian National Military (or
Tentara Nasional Indonesia (TNI)) apologised for the naming of the ship,
but later retracted the apology after backlash from the Indonesian public.</p>
<hr>
<p><strong>The Caning of Michael Fay</strong>
</p>
<p>In 1993, an American teenager Michael Fay was arrested in Singapore for
multiple acts of vandalism and mischief, and the possession of stolen items.[^9]
In 1994, Fay was sentenced to four months’ jail, a fine and six strokes
of the cane.[^10]</p>
<p>As US public opinion intensified against the caning sentence, the Clinton
administration pressured the Singapore Government to commute the caning
sentence. Many US lawmakers criticised the decision and the White House
refused to let then-Prime Minister Goh Chok Tong meet Mr Clinton.[^11]
The US also voted against Singapore’s bid to host the inaugural World Trade
Organisation Ministerial Conference in December 1996.[^12]</p>
<p>Singapore preserved its sovereign right to uphold its rule of law, standing
its ground against external pressures and meting out the caning sentence
to Fay. (Then-President Mr Ong Teng Cheong reduced the number of strokes
from six to four, in view of Mr Clinton’s Presidential plea). If we had
allowed another country to dictate how Singapore should deal with a domestic
law and order issue, we may face similar demands from other countries in
future. Giving in to such demands would compromise the rule of law in Singapore,
and our credibility at home and abroad.[^13]</p>
<p>Nonetheless, Singapore’s principled stand on the matter was widely supported
by Singaporeans and earned us broad respect internationally, even in the
US.</p>

<h4>Examples and Case Studies Related to Upholding the International Rule of Law</h4>
<p><strong>Singapore’s Position on Vietnam’s Invasion of Cambodia</strong>
</p>
<p>In December 1978, Vietnam invaded Kampuchea (presently Cambodia) and toppled
the brutal Khmer Rouge regime, which had ruled the country between 1975
and 1978, and reportedly killed one-third of the population. The Vietnamese
installed a government led by Heng Samrin. <a href="*Ibid.*" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">^14</a> [^15]</p>
<p>Singapore had no sympathy for the Khmer Rouge regime but the invasion
violated an important principle that no country should violate the sovereignty
of another.</p>
<div class="isomer-image-wrapper">
<img style="width: 100%" height="auto" width="100%" alt="" src="/images/wong%20kan%20seng%20speech.png">
</div>
<p>Vietnam’s action was a clear case of violation of international borders
and an act of aggression. If a country could justify invading another based
on the latter’s internal developments, Singapore’s own security and sovereignty
could one day be at risk.[^16] Singapore had to respond, because this could
set an undesirable precedent for small nations, and have serious implications
for Singapore.[^17]</p>
<p>Galvanising ASEAN, then comprising five members (Indonesia, Malaysia,
the Philippines, Singapore and Thailand), Singapore led a concerted effort
to table a resolution at the United Nations General Assembly (UNGA) calling
for the withdrawal of foreign troops from Kampuchea and the recognition
of Kampuchea’s self-determination.[^18]</p>
<p>ASEAN issued a joint statement that was circulated to the United Nations
Security Council (UNSC) in 1979, that “affirmed the right of the Kampuchean
people to determine their future by themselves, free from interference
or influence from outside powers in the exercise of their right of self-determination.”[^19]</p>
<p>ASEAN also spearheaded the 1980 International Meeting of Humanitarian
Assistance and Relief to the Kampuchean People, which took place under
the auspices of the UN Economic and Social Council.<a href="*Ibid.*" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">^20</a>
</p>
<p>Notwithstanding serious differences, Singapore and Vietnam set aside our
differences and forged a strong relationship when Vietnam eventually withdrew
from Kampuchea. The incident also shows that stability and peace in our
region should never be taken for granted.</p>

<p><strong>Case Study: Singapore’s Position on Russia’s Invasion of Ukraine</strong>
</p>
<p>On 24 February 2022, Russian President Vladimir Putin ordered a “special
military operation” to demilitarise and “denazify” Ukraine, a former constituent
republic of the Soviet Union that Russia views as within its sphere of
influence even after its independence in 1991. Since November 2021, increasing
use of disinformation against Ukraine, presumably produced by Russia, and
in support of Ukraine, presumably by the West was observed.</p>
<p><strong>Read more about the Situation in Ukraine <a href="https://www.sg101.gov.sg/resources/resource-packages/neinsights03022022" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">here</a>.</strong>
</p>
<p>Russia’s unjustified and illegal invasion of Ukraine matters to Singapore
because it undermines the international rules and norms under the UN Charter,
and Russia’s exercise of its veto in the UN Security Council to block any
legally binding measures against it undermines the principle which allow
countries, big or small, to interact on an equal footing with one another.
Russia’s violation sets a dangerous and unacceptable precedent for countries,
especially for small states like Singapore. Our security and our very existence
depend on the international rule of law. This is why Singapore strongly
condemned Russia’s unjustified and illegal invasion of Ukraine. As part
of our strong message against the invasion, Singapore has imposed targeted
sanctions and restrictions against Russia to limit its capacity to conduct
war against Ukraine and undermine the latter’s sovereignty and territorial
integrity.[^21] [^22]</p>

<p>In 2014, Singapore similarly opposed Russia’s annexation of the Crimean
Peninsula from Ukraine.</p>

<p>Local media reported in March 2022 that there were TikTok posts that aimed
to influence Singaporeans’ views of Singapore’s principled stand on Russia’s
invasion of Ukraine. As our society becomes more globalised, we will receive
information from a wide range of sources. Singaporeans need to understand
our long-term national interests and make well-informed decisions.</p>
