#### Civic Ownership

Singaporeans play a critical role in ensuring that our limited resources are carefully managed. Campaigns are important tools that help create awareness among Singaporeans of our challenges and how we can help.

<b>Example: Water</b>

These campaigns have helped reduce Singaporeans’ water usage in recent years.

To be more resource-efficient, Singapore has also targeted a Zero Waste goal. This includes being resource-resilient, a move that would always ensure a secure supply of critical resources. The effort will involve everyone, from industrial companies to individual households.

As part of this effort, Singapore is establishing a circular economy that will eliminate waste and maximise the value of resources through recycling and reusing waste materials. The construction industry is already implementing this, where about 99 per cent of construction waste and metals are recycled for new projects. This push has reduced the country’s dependency on sand.

Increasing energy efficiency is also another way to be resource resilient. The Energy Conservation Act implemented in 2013 now requires large energy consumers like industrial companies to adopt good energy management practices. Regular energy audits, establishing energy management systems, and energy efficiency improvement plans are necessary measures.

Households can also play their part in reducing energy use. In addition to this ‘Zero Waste’ movement, the National Environment Agency (NEA) has launched a “Save Energy Save Money” campaign to raise awareness on energy-efficient measures by encouraging Singaporeans to practise simple energy-saving habits.
