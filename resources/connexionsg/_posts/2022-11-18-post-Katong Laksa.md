The Katong Laksa was first sold by brothers Ng Juat Swee and Ng Chwee Seng along East Coast Road in 1963. Today, the popular dish is peddled by several hawkers and franchises, such as 328 Katong Laksa and The Original Katong Laksa at Roxy Square.  
  
Ingredients of the Katong Laksa comprise cockles, prawns, and fishcake, all tossed into an aromatic curry broth that is flavoured with coconut milk and dried shrimp. The ingredients come together to form a rich curry broth bursting with umami flavourfulness and a tinge of spiciness.  
  
A unique feature of the Katong Laksa is how the rice noodles are prepared. The rice noodles are cut up into smaller pieces so that the entire dish can be eaten with a spoon alone, without chopsticks or a fork. This innovative practice allows you to gulp down spoonfuls of the delicious dish with abandon - say goodbye to table manners for the duration! ðŸ˜‹
