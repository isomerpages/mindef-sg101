<p>#OnThisDay (15 Sep 2008), Singaporean swimmer Yip Pin Xiu made history
by bringing home Singapore’s first Paralympics gold medal at the Beijing
Paralympics. 🇸🇬💫 She would then go on to repeat this feat ten more times
at other Paralympics and World Championships events. Despite the challenges
of her muscular dystrophy, Yip Pin Xiu’s grit, spirit, and strength have
blazed a trail for Para sport in Singapore, and have inspired countless
others to challenge their limitations.🏅</p>
<p>Soon, history will be made again. For the first time ever, the World Para
Swimming Championships — the highest-ranked para swimming competition outside
the Paralympic Games — is coming to Asia, and Singapore is proud to be
this landmark event’s host!</p>
<p>From 21 to 27 Sep 2025, over 600 elite para swimmers from 60 nations will
gather at the world-class pool in the OCBC Aquatic Centre, to compete for
World Championship glory 🏊‍♂️🌏 Among them will be top performers from
Paris 2024 Paralympic Games, and rising stars who have set their sights
on the Los Angeles 2028 Paralympic Games.</p>
<p>To have top Para swimmers in the world competing right here in Singapore
is a testament to how far we have come in promoting inclusivity over the
years, As we continue to champion inclusivity for all through the Enabling
Masterplan 2030, let us now cheer on our @Team Singapore's para swimmers,
including athletes like Toh Wei Soong, Wong Zhi Wei, Sophie Soon and defending
champion Yip Pin Xiu – who will doing their best racing on home ground!
As the official slogan goes, “Where limits are broken, and champions are
made”, let’s look forward to celebrating exceptional athletes breaking
boundaries and setting new heights! ❤️‍🔥</p>
