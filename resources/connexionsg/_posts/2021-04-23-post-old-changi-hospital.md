#### Changi's (Not So Hidden) Hospital

On the far flung eastern coast of Singapore lies Changi Point, famed for its rustic charms and coastal boardwalk. Last week, Urban Redevelopment Authority and Singapore Land Authority launched a contest for ideas to rejuvenate the area.

Changi Point is also where the Old Changi Hospital sits along Netheravon Road. Many say itâ€™s haunted, but after digging deeper, we found that it's more than just another creepy old building.
