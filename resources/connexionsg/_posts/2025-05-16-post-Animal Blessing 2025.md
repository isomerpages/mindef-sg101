<p>Have you heard of Vesak Day pet blessing before?
<br>
<br>About 1,000 pet owners and their adorable furkids gathered to receive
blessings from Venerable Sanghas at the Vesak Day pet blessing event this
year! Animal blessings aside, participants had the opportunity to learn
more about Vesak Day, an important day in the Buddhist calendar which commemorates
the birth, enlightenment and attainment of nirvana of Buddha.
<br>
<br>In conjunction with SG60, there were also extensive prayers for our nationâ€™s
happiness, prosperity, and progress!
