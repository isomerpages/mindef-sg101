Because of who you are, I can be everything I am.

We did it before, and we’ll do it again.

Stronger together.

These lyrics come from a trilogy of NDP songs that took our nation through the global pandemic.

“Everything I am” was the first Covid-related song from NDP2020, when our National Day could not be celebrated with a big gathering, for the first time in our history. “Everything I am” reflected the surreal period of separation from community as social distancing forced us to stay home while essential workers braved the contagion. The song's video showed poignant scenes of everyday Singaporeans, reminding us to appreciate one another and the communities that support us, reflecting the stoicism of our people as we adapted to carry on.

“The Road Ahead” was the theme song from NDP 2021, which had been postponed for the first time in our history, to 21 August. A "ceremonial" parade was held on 9 August at The Float at just 30% capacity. “The Road Ahead” showed scenes of past and future hopes, gently reminding us that we can overcome challenges, like our forefathers had done and we have done before.

“Stronger Together” for NDP2022 rallies a nation back to full capacity, rejoicing in our return to big gatherings since the start of the pandemic. “Stronger Together” celebrates the strength of our unity with the most upbeat melody of the Covid-era Trilogy. Are we close to leaving the storms? Whatever the challenge, we certainly can and will rise #StrongerTogether

Happy 57th birthday, Singapore. ❤️
