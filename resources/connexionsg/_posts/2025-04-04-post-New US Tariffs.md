<p>On 2 Apr, the US announced a sweeping 10% tariff on all imports to the
US, including Singapore. Despite a Free Trade Agreement and a trade deficit
with the US, Singapore is not spared.</p>
<p>Here are some things you should know:</p>
<p>(1)&nbsp; &nbsp; The tariffs add uncertainty to global trade. Singaporean
businesses could see <strong>higher costs</strong> and <strong>supply chain disruptions</strong>,
especially those in multi-country manufacturing chains.</p>
<p>(2)&nbsp; &nbsp; While the tariff on goods from Singapore is less than
those on goods from other countries, there will be an impact on Singapore‚Äôs
economy if global trade and economic activities slow down significantly.</p>
<p>(3)&nbsp; &nbsp; Singapore <strong>will not retaliate</strong>, as doing
so could raise costs for Singapore businesses and consumers.</p>
<p>As a small, open economy built on international trade, Singapore won‚Äôt
be immune to the impact. While it is still too early to determine the full
scope of impact from the current tariff regime, let us stay calm and united
and be prepared for rough weather ahead. üí™üèª</p>
<p>Challenges bring opportunities ‚Äî how should Singapore adapt?</p>
