Wondering how to spend a rainy #SundayFunday? ☔

Singapore has one of the world’s largest aquariums, the S.E.A Aquarium, home to about 100,000 marine animals from over 1,000 species, at Resorts World Sentosa (@rwsentosa ).

The aquarium comprises ten zones with 49 habitats. Starting with the Shipwreck Habitat, you’ll find large chunks of shipwreck that the marine animals such as the bow-mouth guitarfish, black-blotched fantail ray, and zebra sharks swim around.

In the next habitat zone, School of Fish, you’ll enter a dark blue underwater tunnel and continue on your journey with the space lit mostly by the floor-to-ceiling cylindrical aquariums themselves. Here, you’ll find schools of fish species that are of Instagram-able hues, such as clownfish, Napoleon wrasse, and seahorses. With the aquariums being lit from inside, it makes it easy to capture nicely lit pictures of the fishes. So go ahead and snap some pictures (without flash photography, please) for your Instagram feed! 📷

The centrepiece of the aquarium is the Open Ocean tank that has a volume of more than 18 million litres (or 4,000,000 imperial gallons) and houses almost 50,000 marine creatures.

Other habitat zones include: Ocean Diversity, Quirky Adaptations, Underwater City, Apex Predators of the Seas, and the Aquatic Ecosystems.

In end-2024, the current aquarium will be expanded to over three times its size, and will be rebranded as the Singapore Oceanarium (SGO). With the expansion, visitors can look forward to an increase in the scale and depth of SGO’s content, such as the use of holographic technology to bring to life realistic versions of rare ocean creatures, and a centre for marine biodiversity education and research, conservation and restoration of vulnerable marine organisms and habitats.

In the lead-up to the opening of the SGO, the S.E.A. Aquarium will remain open to visitors. Head over to look at majestic marine creatures and learn more about marine life conservation! 🐟🐠🐡🦈🐙🦀🦑🐚
