TGIF! Fancy some Mee Rebus to end the work week or during the weekend?

Mee Rebus is a popular noodle dish in Singapore comprising of blanched yellow egg noodles in a sweet, umami gravy, and served with toppings such as boiled egg, bean sprouts, fried tofu, crispy shallots and fresh green chili.

The most important ingredient of the Mee Rebus is, unsurprisingly, the gravy: a rich broth of tiny shrimps, fresh lemongrass, ginger, and shallots, and thickened with mashed sweet potatoes and / or ground peanut. The excellence comes from the intensity, and the combination of salty, sweet and umami flavours. The range of textures, from crunchy sprouts, tender noodles, and thick smooth gravy that just slides down your throat, is also sure to satisfy. A perfect breakfast to start a day, or a delicious supper to reward yourself at the end of the day? You decide!
