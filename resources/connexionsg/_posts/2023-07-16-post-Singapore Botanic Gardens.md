Just about five minutes away from Orchard Road is a place that money cannot buy – the Singapore Botanic Gardens – a lush sanctuary for over 10,000 different species of rare and exotic orchids, vibrant tropical flowers, majestic heritage trees and aromatic herbs.

Opened in 1859, the Botanic Gardens is the custodian of irreplaceable treasures that took time to grow, its various landscape features, plants, and functions led to it being recognised as a UNESCO World Heritage site in 2015 – only the third garden in the world to be bestowed such honours!

Within the Botanic Gardens itself, there are many smaller gardens with various focusses – one of them being the National Orchid Gardens, which currently houses over 1,000 orchid species. Meticulously cultivated, these orchids result in a breath-taking spectrum of colours when they bloom.

The Jacob Ballas Children’s Garden, also housed within the Botanic Gardens, is also the first and largest children’s garden in Asia. The vibrant space provides a safe and interactive environment for children to explore, enjoy and engage in creative play. Its theme, “Life on Earth Depends on Plants”, aims to inspire in children a sense of environmental consciousness and appreciation for the natural world.

There are also plenty of picturesque spots and sights to take in for a visit to the Botanic Gardens – more than enough for a #SundayFunday trip! So pack your bags, charge your phones, and prepare your sandwiches for a great day out at our very own Botanic Gardens!
