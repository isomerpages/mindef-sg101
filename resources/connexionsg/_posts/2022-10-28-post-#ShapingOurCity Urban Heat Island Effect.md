It is not just climate change that is making Singapore warmer - being a city jacks the heat up too.

"All cities, not just Singapore, will face the twin effects of global warming and the urban heat island effect‚Äù, said Mr Peter Ho, Chairman of URA at the Cooling Singapore symposium in 2018.

The Urban Heat Island (UHI) effect refers to the phenomenon where urban structures such as buildings, roads and vehicles trap and release heat into the environment, especially at night. Studies have shown temperature differences of up to 7 degrees Celsius between urban and less built-up areas of Singapore.
To cool down urban heat, Singapore has embarked on a research initiative ‚Äì the Cooling Singapore 2.0 programme, to help identify key sources of UHI to guide our strategies. Findings would go into the planning of buildings and neighbourhoods to mitigate the UHI effect.

Currently, Singapore has adopted various design strategies like the provision of more open spaces around buildings or the use of cooler materials such as white roofs and walls to reduce heat absorption. One may also notice green roofs on top of bus stops to reduce ambient heat!

Tackling UHI requires strong commitment from multiple stakeholders, not just policymakers and industries. No effort is too small, and we can all make a difference by making more conscious choices on heat production, for instance, through reducing our usage of petrol or diesel-powered cars and opting to carpool or cycle instead.
