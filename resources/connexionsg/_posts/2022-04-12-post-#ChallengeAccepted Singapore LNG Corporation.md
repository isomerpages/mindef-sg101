Back in May 2013, Singapore took a significant step when it launched Asia’s first Liquefied Natural Gas (LNG) terminal in Jurong. This marked a major advancement in securing our energy supply for the years ahead! 🇸🇬🌍

Previously, Singapore primarily relied on natural gas delivered through pipelines. But pipeline disruptions — like the one in 2004 that caused blackouts — showed the need for greater energy resilience. The development of LNG capabilities was a crucial move in this direction. ⚡️💡

By cooling natural gas into liquid form, we can now ship it from anywhere in the world. Our terminal reduces our dependence on pipelines, giving us a much more secure and diverse energy mix.

Today, the terminal is capable of delivering up to 6 million tonnes of re-gasified LNG into our national gas network yearly, meeting 30 – 40% of our needs — and that share is growing! When Indonesia adjusted their gas export contracts in 2023, we were ready and prepared, thanks to this foresight.  🙌

But it gets even better! The terminal is also energy-efficient and environmentally friendly. It features three 180,000 m³ Full Containment tanks — the safest option for storing large volumes of LNG. Plus, an energy-saving process is used to pressurise and vaporise the LNG using heat from seawater, which filters out unwanted debris. Before the seawater is returned to the sea, its temperature is slightly lowered to better care for our marine life. 🐠🌊

Looking ahead, Singapore is doubling down on energy resilience. We are developing a second LNG terminal — a Floating Storage and Regasification Unit (FSRU) at Jurong Port, set to begin operations by 2030. This exciting addition will further enhance our energy security and solidify Singapore’s position as a leading LNG hub in the region. 🌐
