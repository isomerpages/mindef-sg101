Today, Singapore generates about 95% of our electricity through natural gas. Until 2013, most of this came from natural gas piped from Indonesia and Malaysia, and any supply disruption could cause blackouts, like in 2004, and upset our daily lives. How does Singapore make sure our power doesn't go off?

#ChallengeAccepted. By approaching the matter in a different state. Literally.

In 2013, after eight years of research and development, we opened Asia's first LNG (liquified natural gas) terminal in Jurong in May 2013. Instead of relying solely on pipelines, the terminal allows us to import natural gas from anywhere in the world, as LNG is gas that has been cooled, shrunk, and ready to be transported. With it, we can now also import LNG from just about anywhere.

In late 2019, Indonesia announced that it would not be renewing one out of the two gas export contracts with Singapore when it expires in 2023. And as Malaysia’s gas deficit widens, there are also concerns over our gas contracts. While both countries still provide 71% of our natural gas, we now have more diverse sources of natural gas. We're even becoming a hub for LNG in Asia, and we continue to expand beyond LNG into other sources of energy.
