Today (1 July) is SAF Day, an annual commemoration day for the armed forces to reaffirm their pledge of loyalty and dedication to the Singapore Armed Forces (SAF) and the nation. SAF Day also allows them to reflect on their role and responsibility in the defence of the nation.

SAF Day was known as Armed Forces Day before 1972. Armed Forces Day was first celebrated on 1 Jul 1969 at the Jalan Besar Stadium. This was, and is a special day, when a 1,500-strong contingent of servicemen and women from the Infantry, Artillery, Engineers, Singapore Armed Forces Training Institute (SAFTI), People‚Äôs Defence Force (PDF) and the Singapore Maritime Command (SMC) pledged their commitment to the nation‚Äôs defence.  

The occasion continues to be commemorated annually through a grand parade presided over by the President of Singapore. The highlight of the parade is the presentation of awards to the best SAF units by the Defence Minister and the presentation of the SAF state colours to the best combat unit by the President. A Trooping of Colours ceremony is then performed to allow servicemen to recognise their regimental colours.

In addition to the parade, SAF Day rededication ceremonies are held islandwide. This allows employers, NSmen and those who have completed their National Service to rededicate themselves to the service of the nation. Many retailers and companies also offer privileges to members of the armed forces on SAF Day as an appreciation of their service to the nation. 

The late Mr Lee Kuan Yew had spoken of the importance of having a strong SAF on several occasions, including at the Temasek Society‚Äôs 30th anniversary dinner dialogue in 2012 and this conviction still holds true today. ‚ÄúFrom the day we started, I knew that we needed a strong SAF and I believe that still remains today. Without a strong SAF, there is no economic future, there is no security,‚Äù he said.

The SAF Day Parade 2023 will be live-streamed on the Ministry of Defence (Singapore)'s social media platforms 4.45pm on 1 July!
