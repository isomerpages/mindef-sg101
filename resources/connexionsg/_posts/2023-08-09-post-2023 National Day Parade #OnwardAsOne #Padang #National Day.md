This year’s National Day Parade (NDP) returns to a key landmark in Singapore at the Padang! Now fronting the Former Supreme Court and Former City Hall buildings, the Padang has borne witness to many significant national events. These include the Japanese surrender ceremony to the British in 1945, the swearing in of President Yusof Ishak in 1959, the declaration of Singapore’s merger with Malaysia in 1963, and Singapore’s independence in 1965.

Our very first and memorable NDP was held at the Padang in 1966. We were also at the Padang in 2015 for our SG50 celebrations, and again in 2019 when we celebrated the bicentennial of the founding of modern Singapore. Indeed, the Padang occupies a special place in Singapore’s history – no wonder it was gazetted as Singapore’s 75th national monument on 9 Aug 2022. 

Themed “Onward As One”, this year’s NDP will feature many firsts – The Digital and Intelligence Service, SAF’s newly established fourth arm, will be making its inaugural NDP appearance as one of five Guard of Honour contingents that will escort the SAF Colours Party. We will also finally see the return of full-scale physical marching contingents for the traditional parade segment, big difference from the toned-down parade in previous years due to the pandemic. Additionally, for the first time in eight years, a large-scale military tattoo featuring 133 talents from the SAF, SPF and combined schools band will form seven unique formations during its performance. 

A new and special segment – the Total Defence Parade – made up of 650 participants along with six large colourful floats each representing a pillar of Total Defence, will also be in the NDP. And in conjunction with Republic of Singapore Air Force (RSAF)’s 55th anniversary, the NDP will feature a “Salute to the Nation” by the RSAF’s F-16 and F-15SG fighter jets. 

In fact, to reach out to more Singaporeans, the National Day festivities will kick off in the heartlands the weekend before Singapore turns 58 on 9 Aug. Amidst the plethora of planned activities, the ‘heart’ behind this year’s NDP is to rally us all to leave the past three years of pandemic behind; and to look forward and move onwards together confidently so as to build a shared future in our Singapore story.

Majulah Singapura! Happy 58th Birthday, Singapore!
