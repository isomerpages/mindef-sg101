Happy “Twos-day”! #OnThisDay, the 22nd day of February falls on a Tuesday. For those into numbers, this day is also interesting as the full dd/mm/yyyy format – 22/02/2022 – is both a palindrome and ambigram. This means that it can be read backwards, forwards, as well as upside down. How rare 😄

Check out some of our military assets with the number "22". Can you identify them?
