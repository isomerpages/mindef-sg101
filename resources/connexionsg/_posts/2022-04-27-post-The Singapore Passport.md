The Singapore passport is currently one of the most powerful in the world, and many of us have come to appreciate the privileges tied to our red passport.

While we hold only one Singapore passport today, there was a time when some Singaporeans had two passports – the blue Singapore Restricted Passport (SRP) for traveling to and from West Malaysia, and a red one for international travels! The SRP was phased out on 1 June 1999 due to a lack of demand, and the red Singapore passport was deemed to the be only valid travel document for overseas travel by Singaporeans from 1 January 2000.

Over the years, the Singapore passport has become a symbol of our nation’s progress, climbing up the ranks of passports that can enter increasing numbers of countries — without the hassle and costs of visa applications. The Singapore passport may be a small book from a small country but it gives Singaporeans the widest reach into the world.
