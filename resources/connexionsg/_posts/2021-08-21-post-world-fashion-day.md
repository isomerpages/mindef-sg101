##### World Fashion Day is marked yearly #onthisday to celebrate the glory, spirit, and art of fashion around the world. What we wear is more than just material sewn together to protect us, our clothes are a signifier of our identities and cultures. 

Like our city itself, Singapore’s fashion scene is an eclectic blend of new and old, simple and ornate, with influences from across the region. And during festivities, we get to see even more of our fashion heritage worn by our multi-cultural people. Here are some of the traditional attire seen around us, and their names.
