<p>Singapore boasts one of the fastest and most reliable internet infrastructures
globally. Access to high-speed internet is ubiquitous, enabling seamless
streaming, gaming, remote work, and communication.
<br>
<br>In Singapore, digital connectivity and accessibility have become so deeply
integrated into daily life, that we have <strong><a href="https://www.facebook.com/hashtag/takenforgranted?__eep__=6&amp;__cft__[0]=AZUMJslM6hBfwx5jwef9DZgrZ7eXibRa0CnvLjMKk_5rgLprReEyxSu1vzhZkZTXP_zfGXvBYVgfdDh2Q1lRZ_OA3QHhxqmxOyxat8-Luq7N7xVB8Uc0Wcz-O4Klx_OEC4q9QRrobUdPpmtZW7sk9T7Iv_Q_T5nWBG9qARe1HaNVOZDuK8jDs9CN5ZLaG2o8pMEM0chiu5OA2apk9Q-8rI4I&amp;__tn__=*NK*F" class="x1i10hfl xjbqb8w x1ejq31n xd10rxx x1sy0etr x17r0tee x972fbf xcfux6l x1qhh985 xm0m39n x9f619 x1ypdohk xt0psk2 xe8uvvx xdj266r x11i5rnm xat24cr x1mh8g0r xexx8yu x4uap5 x18d9i69 xkhd6sd x16tdsg8 x1hl2dhg xggy1nq x1a2a7pz x1sur9pj xkrqix3 xzsf02u x1s688f" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">#takenforgranted</a></strong> the
convenience, efficiency, and innovation it brought to us. A lot of effort
and investment are required to maintain such a robust network and digital
infrastructure.
<br>
<br>In the 1980s and 1990s, Singapore laid the groundwork for its digital
infrastructure, including the development of the Government Integrated
Data Network (GIDN) and the introduction of the Electronic Data Interchange
(EDI) system to facilitate electronic transactions.
<br>
<br>In 1997, Singapore embarked on liberalising its telecommunications sector.
This move paved the way for increased competition and innovation in the
telecommunications industry, leading to improved services and infrastructure.
<br>
<br>The government then launched the Next Generation National Infocomm Infrastructure
(Next Gen NII) initiative in 2006, aiming to build a high-speed broadband
network islandwide. The Nationwide Broadband Network (NBN) project, completed
in 2010, laid the foundation for ultra-fast internet access, enabling connectivity
for homes, businesses, and public institutions.
<br>
<br>In 2014, Smart Nation Initiative was introduced with the goal of leveraging
technology and data to enhance the quality of life, improve the efficiency
of urban operations, and create economic opportunities. This initiative
drove our efforts in digital transformation, innovation, and connectivity
across various sectors.
<br>
<br>Singapore rolled out its 5G network in 2020, marking a significant milestone
in our connectivity journey. 5G technology promises faster speeds, lower
latency, and greater capacity, enabling new applications and services in
areas such as smart cities, autonomous vehicles, and Internet of Things
(IoT). In June 2023, Singapore launched its first Digital Connectivity
Blueprint to chart out a holistic plan for digital connectivity infrastructure
in the next decade.
<br>
<br>In his Budget 2024 speech on 16 February 2024, Deputy Prime Minister Lawrence
Wong announced that the nationwide broadband network will undergo an upgrade
of up to S$100 million (US$74.3 million), moving Singapore towards its
goal of having broadband speeds 10 times faster than what most consumers
are now getting. The upgrade will take place from mid-2024 to 2026, and
higher bandwidth services are expected to be available from as early as
next year. These milestones reflect Singapore's commitment to embracing
technology, innovation, and connectivity to enhance its competitiveness,
sustainability, and quality of life for its residents.
<br>
<br>While we appreciate having one of the fastest internet speed and robust
digital connectivity and accessibility, we should also recognise the potential
for disruptions and prepare contingency plans. For example, we could strengthen
cybersecurity measures to protect against cyber threats that may exploit
disruptions in our digital connectivity. This includes implementing firewalls,
antivirus software, and intrusion detection systems.
<br>
<br>Are we ready for disruptions? To better understand what to do in times
of disruption, the inaugural Exercise SG Ready is being held between 15
to 29 February 2024, where over 500 schools and organisations will simulate
disruptions at various locations across Singapore. The exercise simulates
disruptions of power, water, food supply, digital connectivity and a civil
emergency arising from widespread cyberattacks, disinformation campaigns
and drone attacks from an anonymous actor.</p>
