📷: Four more national symbols have been recognised under the National Symbols Bill.

#TIL four more national symbols – our national pledge, national flower Vanda Miss Joaquim, lion head, and public seal – have been formally recognised under a new Bill on 13 Sep 2022.

The National Symbols Bill replaces the Singapore Arms and Flag and National Anthem (SAFNA) Act, which was enacted in 1959 to govern the use of Singapore's state crest, national flag, and national anthem.

The first three national symbols – the national flag, state crest, and national anthem – were unveiled on 3 Dec 1959. These symbols serve to unify our people.

Singaporeans have increasingly sought to use the flag and other national symbols to show their national pride and solidarity in ways not anticipated by the 1959 rules.

The national flag, Singapore's most visible symbol of statehood, reflects the ideals, beliefs, and values of our nation. Since the COVID-19 pandemic, many Singaporeans have used national symbols like the flag as an expression of our solidarity in challenging times.  

Under this new Bill, there would be more flexibility in usage. A prescribed person – such as the Minister for Culture, Community and Youth – can permit or prohibit the use of the national symbols. For example, the minister can allow the display of the national flag outside of the National Day period from July to September.
