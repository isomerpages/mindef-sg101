Inspired, deeply philosophical, or peculiar?

In 2013, our own Gardens by the Bay unveiled “Planet”, a giant, white sculpture of a baby created by renowned British artist Marc Quinn. The baby sculpture depicts the artists’ then-7-month old son, and was his first sculpture to be installed permanently in Asia.

10-metres long and weighing 7 tonnes, the sculpture of the baby boy seemingly floats above the ground effortlessly. In Quinn’s own words, the sculpture expresses a “paradox -- hugely heavy, yet the bronze appears weightless; overwhelmingly big, yet also an image of vulnerability. It is both a reflection of ourselves and the earth upon which we live”.

The sculpture, located at The Meadow, is a prominent landmark connecting the Gardens to Bayfront MRT Station. Not only does the larger-than-life sculpture add a unique aesthetic to the landscape in Gardens by the Bay, it also makes art more accessible to Singaporeans, enhancing Singapore’s art scene by engaging and inspiring visitors towards an appreciation of art.

If you’re in the area this weekend, see if you would like to pay the sculpture a visit, and don’t forget to snap some photos to commemorate the dramatic sight of a giant floating baby peacefully asleep in our nation’s gardens! 👶
