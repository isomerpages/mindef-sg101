Be prepared to explore when you make it to the new Bird Paradise this #SundayFunday! Opened on 8 May 2023, it replaced the Jurong Bird Park and forms a part of the Mandai Wildlife Reserve.

Home to 3,500 birds across 400 species ranging from loris to pelicans, flamingos, emus, and cassowaries, the Bird Paradise has a lot to offer.

Of the 10 zones in Bird Paradise, eight are walk-through aviaries, each with a different theme inspired by different parts of the world. No matter where you are, you get great views, not just of the feathered friends but of the fantastic scenery as well, whether you’re meandering through boardwalks or canopy walkways on suspension bridges. Each aviary starts and ends with an informational hub that doubles up as a resting point and has a few interactive photo ops too.

Besides feeding sessions, visitors can also get up close and learn more about the residents of Bird Paradise through Keeper Talks, backstage experiences, and animal presentations. There will be three Keeper Talk sessions running – (1) learn more about macaws at the Crimson Wetlands keeper talk sessions; (2) dive deep with Penguin Keeper Talks at Penguin Cove; and (3) discover songbird traits at Songbird Keeper Talks at Songs of the Forest.

Bird Paradise also features two new bird programmes – Predators On Wings and Wings Of The World – which will be presented at the park’s Sky Amphitheatre. This huge space has been designed for raptors like the White-bellied Sea Eagle to make longer flights, while other species can take off from higher platforms to showcase flights from heights that were not previously possible at Jurong Bird Park.
