<p>📷: An extract from the 1885 map of Singapore, showing location of Teng
Chu Kang and the adjacent tributary (NAS)</p>
<p>While Tengah means ‘centre’ in Malay, Tengah is nowhere around the middle
of Singapore. In the 1850s, Tengah was a ‘chu kang’, a term that referred
to gambir and pepper farms located around a river. Each ‘chu kang’ was
led by a ‘kang chu’ (which refers to “Master of the River” in Teochew).
It was said that in the 1853, a ‘kang chu’ named Teng-Ah Tong (colloquially
known as “Teng-ah”) was given a concession to farm the land bounded by
present-day Choa Chu Kang to the northeast, and Jurong East and West to
the south. The land was adjacent to an un-named tributary of the Kranji
River. From there, Tengah was formed.</p>
<p>Dubbed as the new “Forest Town”, the new Tengah estate will be HDB’s 24th
and newest town. When fully developed, it will be about three quarters
the size of Punggol, and can accommodate a total of 42,000 new homes in
all of its five districts. The five residential districts – Plantation,
Garden, Park, Brickland, and Forest Hill – will feature forest and nature
themes strongly in their design and planning, allowing residents to get
up close with nature. For instance, the Plantation District, the first
to be built, will have a community farmway running through its housing
precincts. There will be space dedicated for community gardening and urban
farming, and activities such as sales of organic produce may also be held.</p>
<p>As “going green” is a central concept of the new Tengah HDB town, Tengah
will be Singapore’s first car-free town centre. All roads in Tengah will
have dedicated walking and cycling paths on both sides of the road. The
heart of Tengah town will also feature a large 20 hectares central park
– about the size of Ang Mo Kio Town Garden West – surrounded by ponds and
canals, as well as an amphitheatre. There will be a 100m-wide, 5km-long
forest corridor linking it to the surrounding green network between the
western and central catchment areas.</p>
<p>Also set to be Singapore’s first-ever ‘Smart HDB Town’, Tengah residential
areas will host smart features such as utilities monitoring systems which
will be introduced across the whole neighbourhood. In terms of connectivity,
Tengah will house a depot for the upcoming Jurong Region Line, and the
line will connect areas such as the Jurong Innovation District and the
Jurong Lake District. While the development of new towns can take almost
a decade, they speak of Singapore’s continued commitment to future planning
and meeting the evolving needs of her citizens.</p>
