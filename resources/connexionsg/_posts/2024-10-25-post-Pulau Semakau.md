<p>Located 8km south of Singapore, Semakau is our first and only offshore
landfill. But #DidYouKnow it is much more than just a landfill? It’s a
vibrant example of how Singapore blends waste management with conservation.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Semakau was constructed in 1995 by joining two islands – Pulau Semakau
and Pulau Sakeng – and closing the sea space between them is where the
incinerated ash and other waste are dumped. The landfill is built on a
rock bund lined with impermeable membranes and marine clay, keeping pollutants
from contaminating the sea.&nbsp;</p>
<p>While the island stores waste, it stays clean and green thanks to its
innovative design.&nbsp;Soil is laid over the incinerated waste where over
time, vegetation took root naturally to form a green landscape we see today.
Mangroves from the eastern side of Semakau were also replanted so that
they could thrive, and protect the shores from coastal erosion.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Beyond its landfill role, Semakau boasts stunning ecosystems, including
mangroves, coral reefs, and seagrass beds, home to wildlife like reef fish,
eagles, and endangered hawksbill turtles. It’s no wonder why it has been
known to some as the “Garden of Eden”.</p>
<p>Beyond its biodiversity of flora and fauna on the island, Semakau island
also plays a key role in research on marine life, renewable energy, and
ecosystem restoration. It houses Singapore’s largest wind turbine, and
serves as a testing ground for renewable energy innovations like solar
and tidal power. The island provides a controlled environment where researchers
can test and refine sustainable energy solutions that could be scaled up
across Singapore​.</p>
<p>With the Semakau Landfill projected to reach capacity by 2035, it's crucial
for every Singaporean to take action. Simple steps like reducing single-use
plastics, recycling more, and making eco-friendly choices in daily life
can help extend the landfill's lifespan. By minimising waste, we support
Singapore's push for a zero-waste future. Each of us can play a role in
protecting our environment — whether by composting food waste, using reusable
items, or properly separating recyclables.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Semakau Island is proof that sustainability thrives even in a densely
populated city. Let’s work together for a sustainable future! 🌍💚</p>
