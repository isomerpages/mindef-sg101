The Battle for Singapore was short and swift. Within a week of the Japanese invasion of Singapore, our water distribution system was about to collapse. There was also no more petrol, and very little artillery ammunition and food left. Any counterattack is expected to fail. It seemed like there was no alternative but to surrender.

In the evening, Lieutenant-General Percival and his delegation of senior officers left for the Ford Motor Factory, the HQ of the Japanese. The British wanted to discuss the surrender terms. However, Japanese Lieutenant General Yamashita demanded an immediate, unconditional surrender, and threatened to launch a devastating attack on the city at night. Faced with this ultimatum, Percival signed the surrender document #AtThisTime 6.20pm, the three and a half years of suffering and deprivation under the Japanese Occupation had begun.

Today marks Total Defence Day. It reminds us of what it takes to stay free -- that we must be able to defend Singapore. Whatever we need to do, however hard it is, we vow #neveragainSG and #neverforget. 💪 #WeAreTotalDefence
