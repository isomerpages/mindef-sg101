<p>The word “hongbao” comes from the Chinese word 红包 (hóngbāo), which literally
means “red bag. The significance lies in the red paper, which symbolises
good luck and health, prosperity and happiness. On the eve of Lunar New
Year or the day itself, it is customary for children and grandchildren
to convey best wishes to their parents and grandparents who would in turn
give red packets to them as a form of blessings.
<br>
<br>In Singapore, the giving and receiving of a red packet is a gesture of
appreciation and symbolic of the close bonds that people share. The younger
generation is adding their own flair to the Red Packets by bringing out
trendier designs and sometimes even adding memorable touches such as poems
on them.</p>
