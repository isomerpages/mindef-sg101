<p>Ever wondered why the Lunar New Year doesn’t fall on the same date every
year? Here's why! 👇</p>
<p>The Lunar New Year follows the lunar calendar, and not the Gregorian calendar
many of us use daily.</p>
<p>While the Gregorian calendar follows the Earth’s orbit around the Sun,
the lunar calendar is lunisolar, blending the moon’s phases with the solar
cycle. Thanks to calendar differences, the Lunar New Year falls on a new
moon between the winter solstice and spring equinox.</p>
<p>This unique system shifts the date every year, but one thing never changes
— Lunar New Year is always a celebration of fresh beginnings! 🧧✨</p>
<p>No matter the date, the heart of this beloved tradition remains the same:</p>
<p>🏮 Reuniting with family</p>
<p>🕯️ Honouring cherished traditions</p>
<p>💌 Sharing blessings of health, happiness, and prosperity</p>
