<p>Pulut Tai Tai is a traditional Peranakan delicacy that is made with glutinous
rice, creamy coconut milk, and fragrant pandan leaves, finished with a
sweet kaya jam. The dish is made from glutinous rice that is soaked in
a mixture of butterfly pea flowers, giving it a beautiful blue hue. After
soaking, the rice is steamed until perfectly cooked, resulting in a sticky
and fragrant texture, and then compressed and then left at room temperature
to set for a few hours.
<br>
<br>Traditionally served with creamy coconut milk and a generous sprinkling
of grated coconut, Pulut Tai Tai offers a delightful blend of sweet and
savoury flavours. It pairs wonderfully with savoury dishes like chicken
rendang or served alongside sweet treats like kaya (coconut jam).
<br>
<br>The name 'Tai Tai' hints at the dessert's historical significance, once
reserved for esteemed gatherings and special occasions like weddings and
festivals and enjoyed by the affluent. It is said that this specific kueh
was only served to the wives of rich men back then. Another name for this
kueh is ‘Pulut Tekan’, as ‘tekan’ means ‘to compress’, indicating the way
the rice is prepared. Its vibrant colors and intricate preparation reflect
the craftsmanship and attention to detail valued in Peranakan culture.
<br>
<br>Although Pulut Tai Tai has a rich taste and history, it is now a rare
find on our tables due to the time-consuming and labour-intensive preparation
process, which requires overnight soaking, steaming, and pressing. Nevertheless,
it remains a beloved symbol of our culinary traditions, offering a glimpse
into Singapore's flavourful past.</p>
