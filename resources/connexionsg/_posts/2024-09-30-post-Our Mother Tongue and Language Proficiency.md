Singapore’s education system is underpinned by its bilingual policy, which
also plays an important role in our culture and heritage?
<br>
<br>Singapore’s long-standing bilingual policy requires all Singaporeans to
study the English language and their respective mother tongue language
as part of formal education. English is taught because it is Singapore’s
official working language; while the three official mother tongue languages
- Chinese, Malay and Tamil - serve as a way to strengthen one’s values
and sense of cultural belonging.
<br>
<br>In a study by the Institute of Policy Studies in 2020, over 61% of young
parents (from 26 to 35 years old) used English most frequently with their
children, as compared to older parents (from 56 to 65 years old).
<br>
<br>What does the increased utilisation of the English language at home really
mean to Singapore and Singaporeans?
<br>
<br>On one hand, some are concerned with Singapore inching towards monolingualism
in the future, which could result in an eventual loss of linguistic diversity
and cultural heritage among younger generations. We may also lose our bilingual
and bicultural edge that had allowed Singapore to connect with other countries
and maintained a unique global competitiveness.
<br>
<br>On the other hand, some may argue that English is seen as a unifying language
in the workplace as well as at home. This is especially so with an increasing
number of interracial and transnational families where English is used
to communicate at home. Furthermore, one’s cultural identity and heritage
need not only be shaped through mother tongue languages but through shared
celebrations like Chinese New Year, Hari Raya and Deepavali.
<br>
<br>What do you think? How important is our mother tongue language to our
culture and heritage? We would love to hear your thoughts below!
