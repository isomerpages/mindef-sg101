<p>𝐓𝐋𝐃𝐑: 𝐒𝐢𝐧𝐠𝐚𝐩𝐨𝐫𝐞 - 𝐩𝐨𝐰𝐞𝐫𝐞𝐝 𝐛𝐲 '𝐰𝐞'!👏🤝
<br>
<br>Last night, PM Wong shared a strengthened vision for an exceptional “𝙬𝙚-𝙛𝙞𝙧𝙨𝙩”
society driven by our Singapore spirit. What does this mean for you and
your loved ones?
<br>
<br>Here are 3 things you should know:
<br>
<br>1️⃣ Our jobs: In a world shaped by AI and new technologies, Singapore
will focus on helping both our enterprises and our workers progress and
succeed. New job-matching initiatives will be launched, along with traineeship
programs for graduates and an enhanced SkillsFuture Level Up programme,
to help Singaporeans navigate the changing economic landscape.
<br>
<br>2️⃣ Our families: A strong commitment to nurture our young and seniors
is at the forefront. For our young, stricter measures will be enforced
to protect them online, and from the harms of vaping. For our seniors,
helping them to age with dignity, purpose and joy makes up the essence
of the "Age Well Neighbourhoods", which will bring healthcare and community
services closer to them.
<br>
<br>3️⃣ Our home: Our not-so-ulu Northern part of Singapore is set to transform.
Major rejuvenation plans are in store for Woodlands, Kranji and Sembawang,
which will see new housing estates, transportation and amenities, and improved
cross-border links with Malaysia. Singapore will also see continued efforts
in fortifying our climate resilience, particularly coastal protection around
our island.
<br>
<br>Let’s continue to hold fast to the Singapore Spirit, 𝙗𝙚𝙡𝙞𝙚𝙫𝙚 𝙞𝙣
𝙤𝙣𝙚 𝙖𝙣𝙤𝙩𝙝𝙚𝙧, and rise above. We will remain exceptional. Let’s
write the next chapter of our Singapore Story, 𝙩𝙤𝙜𝙚𝙩𝙝𝙚𝙧.
