Are you ready for the Lunar New Year? ðŸ§¨

From the exterior, Kueh Bangkit seems hard and dry, but one bite will give the sensation that it is melting in the mouth, while still remaining crispy when chewed. Together with the sweet swirl of coconut-y aroma bursting in your mouth, this is a traditional treat that has delighted Singaporeans for generations.

Making it requires great attention to detail. The ingredients are simple but excellence comes from the quality of the sources: the freshest tapioca flour, coconut cream, egg yolks, and white or palm sugar. The mixture calls for precision to get that mouth-melting effect: the flour has to be dried out by heating it first (with pandan leaves to infuse fragrance), the egg yolk must be completely free from egg white (to avoid hardening the dough), the coconut cream must be added in the perfect amount (not too much, not too little) for optimal crumbling, and the oven temperature has to be just right (to bake without browning). All that for an airy treat that tastes like a dream.

Where do you get your Kueh Bangkit from? And how many do you eat at a go? ðŸ˜‹
