Ever spotted one of these squirrel-like creatures clinging onto trees or suspended from horizontal branches?

That would be the Flying Lemur, a species of mammal native to Southeast Asia. Now, despite its namesake, the ‘Flying’ Lemur does not literally fly like a bird or bat would. Instead, it has a membrane of kite-shaped skin known as patagium that stretches from its neck to the tips of its fingers and toes, allowing it to glide through the air between trees -- perhaps naming it the “Gliding Lemur” would be more appropriate! 😜

At roughly 30-40 cm in length, these tiny creatures sport irregular black streaks and white blotches with a white-ish eye ring. Singapore’s Flying Lemur population is concentrated mostly in the Central Nature Reserves and Bukit Batok Nature Park, and as herbivores mostly feast on flowers, flower buds, leaves, and shoots.

Try spotting these cute little creatures the next time you are in these areas, but do resist the temptation to touch them or bring them home as your pet -- they’re protected under our nation’s Wildlife Act, which prohibits them being hunted or captured! 😆
