<p>When was the last time you ate Putu Mayam?</p>
<p>In the Malayan languages, the word ‘putu’ is translated to ‘rice cake’,
while the ‘mayam’ may have been derived from the word ‘mayang’ which is
translated as ‘grated coconut’.</p>
<p>Best served cold, Putu Mayam is made of rice flour strands that have a
soft, fluffy texture, and pairs well with freshly grated coconut and red
sugar. Its appearance is like that of noodles, very much like the vermicelli
noodles used for Chinese dishes. It is usually eaten for breakfast or as
a snack.</p>
<p>The dish has been around in Singapore as early as the 1920s when street
hawkers wrapped the dish in newspaper and carried it in a basket balanced
on their heads. It used to be served with gula melaka cut into small blocks
instead of the granulated sugar we see today.</p>
<p>Today, freshly-made Putu Mayam is not commonly found. Even though the
dish looks simple, only a handful of stalls make it from scratch as it
is a tedious process. The main ingredient for the Putu Mayam strands is
rice flour. Rice flour is first carefully roasted with pandan before water
is added to form a smooth, sticky dough. The dough is then set aside to
rest. Upon order, the dough is filled into a hand wooden press with holes.
A lot of strength is required to force the dough through the holes for
the thin strands to form. Finally, the strands are placed on greased rattan
trays or pandan leaves and steamed for 30 seconds.</p>
<p>A more traditional way of serving the dish would be to put it on a banana
leaf to make for easier consumption without the need for a spoon and fork.</p>
<p>While it remains a dish sometimes served on Indian festive occasions such
as Deepavali and Indian weddings, the Indian Muslim community has helped
to make Putu Mayam a popular dish during Ramadan and other Malay festivities.</p>
