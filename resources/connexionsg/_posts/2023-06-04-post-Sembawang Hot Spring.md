![](/images/connexionsg/2023/hot%20spring.PNG)Who wouldn’t want a trip to Japan to enjoy its famed hot springs? Sadly, the realities of life get in the way -- school, internships, work commitments, finances, and so on…

Well, #didyouknow that Singapore has its very own hot spring? Its water probably originates somewhere from Bukit Timah hill (nobody is completely sure), travelling underground and heated to hot temperatures by hot rock masses, and emerges in Sembawang, cooled to a comfortable 70 degrees celsius.

The hot spring was discovered by rangers in 1908 in the Sembawang pineapple estate belonging to Seah Eng Keong, a Chinese merchant. When news of this discovery got out, the hot spring became an instantaneous hit with the local populace. Villagers would frequently seek its waters for its supposed healing power. Others went there to boil eggs, wash clothes, and even de-feather poultry. Since the 1960s, punters (horse-racers) would also take a bath with water collected from the hot spring on race days for ‘good luck’.

Today, the main highlight of the park is the Cascading Pool, where the groundwater is cooled through a series of pools to bring the water down to a more comfortable temperature. Visitors can often be found sitting along the pool edge, soaking their feet into the warm hot spring water. Visitors can also imitate the villagers’ habits of years past at the egg-cooking station (although you would be required to bring your own eggs, bowls, and utensils)!

Today, the Sembawang Hot Spring Park is a prime location for Singaporeans who wish for a brief escape from the urban lifestyle and environment, even for just a moment -- perfect for your next #SundayFunday activity!
