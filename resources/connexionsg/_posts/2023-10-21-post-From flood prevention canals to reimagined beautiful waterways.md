<p>Between 1960s – 1970s, there were records of three major floods that resulted
in casualties, damages to property, and disruptions to electricity and
power supply. Flooding incidents intensified as rapid development of housing
and industrial estates led to increased surface flows to the drainage waterways.
How do we then mitigate widespread flooding?</p>
<p>#ChallengeAccepted. By transforming our waterway network and infrastructure.</p>
<p>From 1980s, recognising that water bodies and waterways could play more
than just a functional role, in 1989 the Urban Redevelopment Authority
(URA) developed a plan to boldly reverse what had been the status quo:
by concretising and canalising waterways.</p>
<p>Concrete waterways are necessary features in our highly developed urban
landscape, as they perform the critical function of transporting storm
discharge in limited urban space. Due to Singapore’s tropical climate,
these monsoon canals tend to be empty and thus very unattractive during
dry seasons.</p>
<p>Yet others may be unaware that this innovative stormwater management measure
is a direct outgrowth of Singapore’s decades-long experience of combatting
what had once been regular and severe floods across the island. In fact,
lying beneath the surface of the Kallang River is an inspiring story of
crisis transformed into opportunity.</p>
<p>Launched in 2006 by the Public Utilities Board (PUB), Singapore's National
Water Agency, the ABC (Active, Beautiful, Clean) Waters Programme aims
to transform waterways and reservoirs in Singapore beyond their drainage
and water storage functions, to create clean and beautiful rivers and lakes
while allowing these spaces to be used for community bonding and recreation.</p>
<p>The outcome? Each time a torrential downpour occurs, the water level in
the Kallang River at Bishan-Ang Mo Kio Park rises and the adjacent park
space becomes a floodplain to channel stormwater downstream to Marina Reservoir.
This trademark characteristic of the waterway’s rejuvenation under the
ABC Waters Programme attracted the attention of curious onlookers. Some
even took to social media to express concern at this sight.</p>
<p>Today, Singapore is relieved of prolonged floods. Flood-prone areas, which
are low-lying areas with a history of flooding, have been reduced significantly
from about 3,200 hectares in the 1970s to 30.5 hectares in 2016 despite
increased urbanisation. Most times, our drains can cope with the rainfall
that we receive. Through our concerted efforts in stormwater management,
we have also transformed our urban landscape intensively, by integrating
blue spaces within our urban fabric.</p>
