<p>No more ‘guess-the-price’ at caifan (economy rice) stalls! 🍚💰</p>
<p>Ever hesitated at the caifan stall, wondering if that extra chicken wing
or piece of fish would blow your budget? Well, mystery pricing is set to
become a thing of the past — at least at 77 Koufu food courts and coffee
shops by the end of this year.</p>
<p>As part of an initiative by the Consumers Association of Singapore (CASE)
and Koufu, new price labels will be introduced for every dish, so you’ll
know exactly how much your plate will cost before you reach the cashier.
No more mental gymnastics or awkward “huh, so expensive ah?” moments.</p>
<p>This initiative will benefit both customers by making it easier to understand
pricing and choices, and stall operators by promoting fair and clear pricing.</p>
<p>Would clear pricing change how you order your caifan? Share your thoughts!
