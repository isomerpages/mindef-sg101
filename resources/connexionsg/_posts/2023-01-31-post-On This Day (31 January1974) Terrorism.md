#OnThisDay (31 January) in 1974 four armed men from the Japanese Red Army and Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine planted bombs at the petroleum tanks at Pulau Bukom. During their escape, the terrorists hijacked a ferry boat, Laju, and took its crew members hostage. They demanded the release of their jailed comrades in other countries.

Fortunately, the damage from the blasts was contained, and the crisis was diffused after several public officers volunteered to act as guarantors for the safe passage of the terrorists in exchange for the release of the civilian hostages: they accompanied the terrorists on a special flight to Kuwait, where they disembarked before the terrorists took off for Aden.

Had the attack gone as the attackers planned, the supply of oil to the region would have been severely affected, as Singapore was the worldâ€™s third-largest refining centre. Singaporeâ€™s reputation as a safe location for foreign investment would have also taken a beating.

The Laju incident highlighted the need for coordinated inter-agency action, setting in motion Singaporeâ€™s whole-of-government approach in crisis management. It was also a reminder of the need to never be complacent and to always strengthen our security capabilities.

Today, there are increasing threats of terrorist attacks by self-radicalised individuals who are influenced by extremist propaganda on social media. As radicalisation is not limited to any religion or ethnic group, Singapore has also moved to deepen inter-religious and cross-cultural understanding as well as re-integrate those who have been radicalised back into society with the support of community and religious leaders. Additionally, the government has taken swift action to counter hate speech and moved to ban religious speakers espousing views that incite hatred for another race or religion.

We can all play a part to safeguard our way of life against the threats of terrorism. The SGSecure movement highlights three core actions we can take:

-- Staying alert to prevent a terror attack and keeping our family, friends, and ourselves safe in the event of a terror attack. 

-- Staying united through building strong bonds with our friends and neighbours in the community, and cherishing the racial and religious harmony in Singapore.

-- Staying strong and resilient as individuals and as a community, and be ready to help one another and bounce back quickly after a terror attack.

Do contact the ISD Counter-Terrorism Centre hotline on 1800-2626-473 if you: (1) observe suspicious activities or signs of radicalisation; or (2) are aware of anyone becoming involved in terrorism-related activities, including planning or taking steps to travel to conflict zones to take part in armed conflict. 

Together, we keep Singapore strong.
