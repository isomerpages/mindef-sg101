Undecided where to head for lunch during this Friday afternoon? Head over to your homeâ€™s / workplaceâ€™s nearest Yong Tau Foo joint!

Relatively inexpensive and with multiple ingredients to choose from, no wonder Yong Tau Foo is a lunchtime favourite among Singaporeans. Customers can usually choose a variety of vegetables, mushrooms, and meats, many of which are stuffed with a mixture of fish paste, garlic, and soy sauce, which adds a delicious savoury flavour in the dish.

The mixture of chosen ingredients are then boiled or fried, and served either dry or in a flavourful broth. Here, Yong Tau Foo vendors have also taken the initiative to cater to Singaporeansâ€™ love for spicy food by availing thick, creamy laksa gravy as a serving option, resulting in a light but hearty meal that may just help you avoid the dreaded post-lunch food coma! ðŸ˜œ
