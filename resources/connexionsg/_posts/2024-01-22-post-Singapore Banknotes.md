<p>Bank notes can be iconic and tell unique stories. The designs of our bank
notes often reflect Singapore's multicultural identity, incorporating elements
from various ethnic groups and historical events.
<br>
<br>Even in the advent of cashless payment, we sometimes still use bank notes
in our daily lives â€“ from ordering kopi at our nearby coffee shop or gifting
of angbaos during the Lunar New Year. Watch till the end to learn more
about the different series of notes we have in Singapore! ðŸ¤‘</p>
