You probably know that Singapore is one of the most water-stressed countries in the world -- we lack natural water resources, and we do not have ample land for water storage facilities.

Cue… Water Wally and his younger sister, Sally -- a pair of friendly, helpful, and kind mascots on a mission! Revealed to the public by PUB in 2005 and 2020 respectively, the siblings aim to help younger Singaporeans realise the importance of reducing water wastage and water sustainability in Singapore — to start them on a lifelong journey of water conservation.

The mascots appear in various educational materials, events, and campaigns, including a hilarious dance with Baby Shark. PUB also launched the Water Wally and Sally club in 2021, a water-themed club for children 12 years old and below, to engage interest in climate change and water conservation topics.

But with their cute, round shapes, Water Wally and Sally are also stealing the hearts of Singaporeans of all ages — they bring a cheerful optimism to the enormous challenge of managing water resources for our nation’s survival!
