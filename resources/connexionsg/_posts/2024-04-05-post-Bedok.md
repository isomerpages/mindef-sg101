<p>‘Bedok’ is one of the earliest recorded place names in Singapore. Did
you know that the Bedok region is over 400 years old? The name ‘Bedok’
was first recorded in the 1604 Manuel Gomes de Erédia's map of Singapore,
where there is a reference to the Bedok River called ‘sune bodo’ (Sungei
Bedok).</p>
<p>Bedok is one of the early native place names in existence around the time
of Sir Stamford Raffles. Originally a fishing village inhabited by Malay
and Orang Laut communities, Bedok's name is derived from the Malay word
‘bedoh’, referring to a type of slit drum used in Malay culture. The area
was known for its abundant seafood and fertile soil, making it an ideal
settlement for the early inhabitants.</p>
<p>During the colonial era, Bedok remained primarily rural, with its economy
centred around agriculture and fishing. However, significant development
began in the 1950s with the Singapore government's housing initiatives
to accommodate the growing population. Bedok experienced rapid urbanisation
and transformation into a modern town, marked by the construction of public
housing estates, infrastructure, and amenities.</p>
<p>One notable landmark in Bedok's history is the Bedok Reservoir, which
was originally a sand quarry. In the 1980s, the quarry was converted into
a reservoir to address Singapore's water needs, and Bedok Reservoir Park
was established, providing a recreational space for residents.</p>
<p>Bedok also used to be home to the iconic Bedok Stadium, which was a popular
venue for sporting events, concerts, and community gatherings. It was known
for its iconic wave-shaped roof. This distinctive design gave the stadium
a memorable and recognisable appearance, setting it apart from other venues.
It was a cherished landmark for residents until its closure in 2000.</p>
<p>Over the years, Bedok has evolved into a vibrant residential and commercial
hub, characterised by its diverse population, bustling markets, hawker
centres, and shopping malls. Today, Bedok continues to thrive as a dynamic
neighbourhood, blending the old with the new, while maintaining its unique
identity and charm.</p>
