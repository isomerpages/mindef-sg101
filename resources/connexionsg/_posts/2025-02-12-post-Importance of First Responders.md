<p>In times of crisis, every second counts. An inspiring story of two Cedar
Girls’ students responding to a cardiac arrest emergency after receiving
a myResponder notification proves that anyone, regardless of age, can make
a difference in an emergency.</p>
<p>As a nation, Singapore’s strength lies in our readiness to help one another.
By being alert to emergencies, every Singaporean can play a part in building
a more resilient and caring society.</p>
