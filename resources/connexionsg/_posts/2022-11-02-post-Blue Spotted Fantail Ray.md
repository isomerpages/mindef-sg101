This might surprise you, but Singapore’s waters contain plenty of unique marine life! The blue-spotted fantail ray (Taeniura Lymma) is one of them. If you’re an avid diver, you may have spotted one of these beautiful creatures near the Southern Islands such as Pulau Hantu and St. John’s Island!  
  
Blue-spotted Fantail Rays grow up to about 30cm in diameter. Its oval-shaped body is covered in bright blue spots - hence its name. These rays eat a variety of prey - snails, clams, worms, shrimps, and crabs. When not feeding, the ray seeks shelter in underwater caves and ledges.  
  
Sadly, the Blue-spotted Fantail Ray faces pressure from human activity. Overfishing is one of the dangers. Many rays are also trapped in fishing nets and ultimately die. Hopefully, even as Singapore progresses, we will also be more sensitive to the needs and survival of our marine life - no life, big or small, should be left behind. 🐠🐬🐙
