Bak Chor Mee (literally translated to â€˜minced meat noodlesâ€™ in Hokkien) features a delectable combination of springy egg noodles and tender minced pork.

Like many Singaporean dishes, it is available either with soup or dry. The soup version is laden with an umami richness while the dry version features an explosive vinegar and chilli-based sauce.

The meat used in the Bak Chor Mee is mostly pork, which is minced. In other cases, generous servings of pork liver or pork slices can also be used in the preparation of Bak Chor Mee. It often also includes meat balls if the dish is prepared to a soupy consistency.

For the dry version, minced or sliced mushrooms and lettuce are sometimes added to complement the dish. It is then topped with small pieces of crispy fried sole fish as garnish.

Both versions of Bak Chor Mee are served with lard croutons called â€˜bak pokâ€™ which adds a bit of crispness, and caramelised fried garlic which adds aroma and savouriness to the dish. There is also a slight toasty taste from the caramelisation.

Between the dry and soupy Bak Chor Mee, which do you prefer? ðŸ¤¤
