<p>In 1965, shortly after independence, Lee Kuan Yew said that Singapore
"is not a country that belongs to any single community; it belongs to all
of us."</p>
<p>Singapore, indeed, belongs to all of us. And we’ve all chipped in to bring
Singapore this far.</p>
<p>It has never been easy, but as realists at heart, we know that our ideals
must be matched by effort. So we work at it, expanding our common spaces
and, in times of conflict, acting quickly to restore faith and trust in
one another.</p>
<p>We formed platforms like Inter-Racial and Religious Confidence Circles
to build solidarity across cultures. We review our policies and programmes
to serve people with greater understanding. We look for ways to build empathy
amidst our differences — in 2019, instead of retaliating to insensitive
remarks, the Sikh community helped that person learn more about their culture.</p>
<p>The work is ongoing. At times we’ve said or done things that hurt one
another, which we can’t take back. But we can learn from our mistakes so
that something better can emerge. Take our challenges as opportunities
to cultivate compassion, overcome ignorance, and strengthen bonds with
one another. So let’s keep at it and shape a Singapore that is #EvenBetter,
together.</p>
