<p>Did you spot the beautiful sun halo over Singapore on 25 Aug 2025? ☀️🌈</p>
<p>That dazzling ring of light happens when sunlight passes through high-altitude
ice crystals in thin cirrus clouds. The crystals bend and reflect the rays,
forming a perfect circle around the sun — a reminder that even the tiniest
particles in our skies can come together to create something spectacular.</p>
<p>Like the halo, our strength as a nation comes from unity. When each of
us, like the ice crystals, plays our part — bending, adapting, and standing
together — we form something larger, brighter, and stronger than ourselves.
💪🇸🇬</p>
<p>This is nature’s way of reminding us that beauty and strength shine through
when we unite. 🌏❤️</p>
