Fried Hokkien prawn noodles, known locally as Hokkien mee, is a dish comprising thick yellow noodles and bee hoon fried in a rich prawn and pork stock, garnished with pork lard, and served with chilli and lime on the side.

The key to this dish is copious quantities of an aromatic stock made from prawns and pork bones, slowly simmered for many hours. The noodles were stir-fried and stewed in rich stock over fire until it was nearly all dried up and all its flavours infused in the wet noodles. Ingredients such as squid, prawns, pork belly, and small cubes of lard cracklings were added to the noodles.

Some stalls also serve the Hokkien mee on an opeh leaf (soft areca palm bark), which enhances the fragrance of the dish as it releases a subtle, woody fragrance that seeps into the food and enhances its taste when wrapped.

The dish is considered a classic of Singaporean cuisine and several hawker stalls selling it have been recognised by the Michelin Guide. Do you have a favourite Hokkien mee stall? Tell us! ðŸ˜‹
