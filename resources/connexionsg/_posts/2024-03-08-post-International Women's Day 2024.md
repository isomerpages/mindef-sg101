<p>On International Women's Day, we reflect on the history of the movement
for gender equality. The United Nations General Assembly officially recognised
8 March as a day to celebrate women's rights and global peace in 1975.
However, the journey towards gender equality began earlier with labour
movements in North America and Europe at the turn of the 20th century.
Today, the occasion remains a beacon of hope, highlighting the progress
made and the work that still needs to be done to achieve true equality.

<br>
<br>International Women's Day in Singapore is celebrated through a combination
of educational, cultural, and advocacy-focused activities aimed at promoting
gender equality and empowering women and girls in society. Organisations,
non-profits, and government bodies often organise public events such as
panel discussions, workshops, seminars, and conferences focusing on women's
issues, empowerment, and gender equality. Art galleries, museums, and cultural
institutions may organise exhibitions showcasing the works of female artists,
photographers, writers, and performers. These exhibitions often explore
themes related to gender, identity, and women's experiences.
<br>
<br>From trailblazing activists to everyday heroes, women continue to inspire
and shape our world. This year, let's take the time to acknowledge the
women in our lives and their valuable contributions. Let's honour their
strength, resilience, and unwavering spirit as we strive for a future where
every woman can thrive. üíñ‚úä</p>
<p>Who are the women who inspire you? Share their stories and spread the
empowerment!
