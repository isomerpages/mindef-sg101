Kranji Marshes, one of the largest freshwater marshes in Singapore, was formed by accident in the 1970s.

Back then, when Sungei Kranji was dammed up to create Kranji Reservoir, the low-lying grounds flooded as water flowed in, forming a freshwater marshland and attracting wildlife. However, the open water surface was soon covered by thick vegetation, cutting off food sources for the birds. 

In 2008, recognising the rich biodiversity of the area, Nature Society of Singapore adopted the marshes under PUB's ABC Waters Programme. Parts of the vegetation were cleared, two small mud islands were created for birds, and a maintenance plan was formed to sustain the wildlife in the area. In 2014, URA and NParks joined in the efforts to help plan and develop the area to enhance its natural biodiversity. To allow Singaporeans to access and learn about this marshland, there was a dedicated effort to build amenities and features, while striving for a balance between vegetation and birds, wildlife and humans.

Today, at almost 57 hectares, Kranji Marshes is home to a rich array of flora and almost 200 species of resident and migratory birds, 54 species of butterflies, and 33 species of dragonflies; and also functions as a natural filtration system for water entering Kranji Reservoir. 

Officially opened in 2016, Kranji Marshes was added as a project under the Nature Conservation Masterplan. In densely populated Singapore, conserving nature and greenery is key to ensuring a high quality living environment. Through such conservation efforts, we can continue to build Singapore as a City in Nature, where our wildlife can better thrive and interact across the island, for the benefit of all Singaporeans. #ShapingOurCity
