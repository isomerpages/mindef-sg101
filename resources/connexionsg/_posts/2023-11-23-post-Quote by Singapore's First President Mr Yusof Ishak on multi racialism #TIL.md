#TIL our first President, Mr Yusof Ishak's 1968 New Year message about multi-racialism remains a guiding light for our nation: "No man need feel that to belong to a particular religion puts him at a disadvantage or gives him an advantage... This is how things are in Singapore and this is how things must always be in our country. Only in this way can a multi-racial society like Singapore live in peace and prosperity."

Mr Yusof Ishak highlighted three key principles:

• Peace, Goodwill, and Tolerance – These virtues are shared across all religions and “can be and should be used to bridge other kinds of differences between men”.

• Pride of One’s Language and Culture – “He has every right to be as proud of his language and culture as you are of yours”.

• Understanding – “You should make an effort to understand his language and culture because there may be much you can learn from them.”

In the increasingly troubled world that we live in, Singaporeans must safeguard the harmony our forefathers worked hard to build. Let's not take for granted the unity that sets us apart. As we reflect on these principles, share how you are contributing to Singapore’s multi-racial, multi-religious, and multi-cultural harmony! 🇸🇬
