<p></p>
<p>Located in the eastern region of Singapore, it is hard to imagine Tampines‚Äô
former rural days as a farming and fishing village with plantations, when
juxtaposed with the sheer number of people at Tampines today.</p>
<p>The earliest record of Tampines was believed to be found in the Tampenus
River in Lieutenant Philip Jackson‚Äôs 1828 map of Singapore, and the river
probably derived its name from the Tempinis tree that grew abundantly in
the area then.</p>
<p>Tampines Road had formerly been a bridle path accommodating horse and
pedestrians, which was later converted into a cart tract in the 1860s.
The road, which extended towards Sungei Tampines (Tampines River), spanned
from the 6th milestone of Serangoon Road (known as Kovan today) to Changi
Road near the eastern tip of Singapore. Many early village dwellers settled
along this road, and some of the villages here included Kampong Teban,
Teck Hock Village, Hun Yeang Village and Kampong Tampines. It was a main
access mostly used by coconut plantation workers, sand miners and travelling
hawkers.</p>
<p>Many Tampines dwellers would remember the sand quarries that existed in
Tampines, as Tampines was associated with the sand quarrying and waste
disposal industry from the 1960s to the 1980s. Sand from Tampines was used
for the building of Housing &amp; Development Board (HDB) towns in the
1960s, and demand for the material was so high that at its peak, there
were 26 sand quarries operating in Tampines.</p>
<p>Tampines is a notable town of many firsts. The construction of Tampines
New Town began in 1979. Being the first new town developed based on a neighbourhood
and precinct planning concept by the HDB, Tampines marked a new milestone
in the evolution of HDB‚Äôs residential development typology.</p>
<p>The Tampines Central Park, which houses the well-loved watermelon and
mangosteen playgrounds, is an example of the HDB‚Äôs introduction of integrated
green spaces as part of its town planning innovations in the 1980s. Pioneered
in Tampines, this concept was the precursor to the park connectors that
are found all across Singapore today.</p>
<p>Besides that, Tampines is also Singapore‚Äôs first regional centre ‚Äì a ‚Äúmini
city‚Äù containing offices, homes and recreational facilities, following
a 1991 concept plan to grow commercial and retail centres in suburban areas.</p>
<p>Our Tampines Hub too, was Singapore‚Äôs first integrated community and lifestyle
hub. It was constructed based on public consultation involving more than
15,000 Tampines residents. The 5.3-hectare multi-purpose complex houses
various amenities, including retail shops, a hawker centre, a regional
library, spaces for community events, and sports facilities such as badminton
courts, amongst others.</p>
<p>It was highly unlikely that anyone living here in the 1980s could imagine
that Tampines would receive the United Nations‚Äô World Habitat Award in
1992, beating out contending entries from cities such as Vancouver and
Boston. The award recognises innovative and successful human settlements,
and marked a significant achievement in Singapore‚Äôs public housing. Overnight,
Tampines New Town became recognised as an exemplar of ‚Äúhigh-quality, high-density
and affordable housing‚Äù, and was touted as a model that cities around the
world could replicate.</p>
<p>Today, Tampines stands as a prime example of the importance of thoughtful
urban planning. As Tampines continues to evolve, the heart of its development
remains rooted in fostering a strong sense of community and neighbourliness
among its residents.</p>
