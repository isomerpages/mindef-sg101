One of Singapore's most important industrial islands is named after a seashell?</p>
<p>Shaped like a cone snail, or<em> rangkek bukom</em> in Malay, Pulau Bukom
is located 5.5km southwest of mainland Singapore and home to Shell Energy
and Chemicals Park Singapore.</p>
<p>Identified for its strategic location, proximity to Jurong Island, and
natural resources, Pulau Bukom has a rich industrial history that dates
back to 1891 when the first petroleum tank depot was set up.</p>
<p>Today, it stands as Shellâ€™s only Energy and Chemicals Park in Asia. It
is integral to Singapore's energy and chemical industries, as well as the
nationâ€™s status as a major global trading and manufacturing hub.</p>
<p>Since the 2010s, Shell has been progressively working towards greater
sustainability, including the production of low-carbon energy products
such as biofuels and the provision of renewable energy. Shell is also playing
a pioneering role in the electrification of transport, with the launch
of Singaporeâ€™s first fully electric ferry service in 2023, which is expected
to cut more than 6,200 tonnes of carbon dioxide emissions annually. This
shift is not just industrial, it reflects Singaporeâ€™s broader commitment
to a low-carbon, resilient economy under the Singapore Green Plan 2030.</p>
<p>Today, many workers reside on Pulau Bukom or commute there by ferry from
the Pasir Panjang Ferry Terminal. Besides oil processing plants, there
are also many other facilities like a mosque, a Hindu temple and even badminton
courts!</p>
<p>Pulau Bukomâ€™s evolution from an oil depot to a green-energy island is
a symbol of Singaporeâ€™s adaptive spirit, showing us that transformation
is possible. It reminds us that sustainability isnâ€™t about starting from
scratch, itâ€™s about innovating on what already exists.</p>
<p>In a world facing climate crises, rising sea levels, and resource scarcity,
Pulau Bukom is a hopeful reminder that even the most industrialised places
can become greener, smarter, and more resilient. What would it look like
if we approached our lives the same way? Whether itâ€™s reducing waste, using
cleaner energy, or simply rethinking our daily habits, how would you choose
to make a difference?</p>
<p>Note: The island is off limits to the general public.</p>
