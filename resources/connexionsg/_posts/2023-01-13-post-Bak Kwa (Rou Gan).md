What‚Äôs your favourite Lunar New Year sweet treat?

For many, their favourite snack would be the bak kwa, also known as rougan (ËÇâÂπ≤) (literally ‚Äúdried meat‚Äù). Usually taking the form of thin square slices, bak kwa is traditionally made from pork and seasoned with several ingredients such as salt, pepper, sugar, honey, soya sauce, rice wine, five-spice powder, and fish sauce!

A very popular delicacy in Singapore, bak kwa have taken on many variations over the years. For instance, bak kwa made from chicken or beef are now available as alternatives for those with dietary restrictions. Healthier versions of bak kwa (it‚Äôs not the healthiest of foods!) have also emerged in the market, made with turkey or less fatty pork loin and contains less MSG or flavouring. And of course, not forgetting spicy bak kwa üå∂ ‚Äî a must-have to satiate Singaporeans‚Äô love for spicy food!

Many of us will certainly be excited to indulge in this delicious treat with our friends and relatives during this festive period, but remember to have it in moderation for the best Lunar New Year experience possible!
