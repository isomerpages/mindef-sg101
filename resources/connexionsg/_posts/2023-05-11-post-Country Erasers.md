Many of us who went to primary school in the 2000s would hold fond memories of “country erasers” -- and the fact that almost nobody used these erasers to ‘erase’ anything. 😬

Small, easily accessible, and sold cheaply in single units or in packs at the school’s stationery shop, it became an accomplishment for some to collect them all (like Pokemon)!

For those with a more… competitive spirit, we would spend pockets of free time between classes or during recess battling our friends with these erasers. How does one do battle with such an innocuous object, you may ask?

Well, one variation of a “country eraser battle” (or “showdown” for the more dramatic) was for each competitor to take turns to flick their respective erasers in quick succession -- victory is achieved when an eraser lands fully on top of the rival’s. Another variation would be to affix stapler bullets into the bottom of the eraser in an asterisk pattern to make an “eraser beyblade”. Competitors would then spin the erasers and try to knock the opponent’s out of the boundary (usually a desk).

These adrenaline-filled games would often be filled with yelling, whooping, and laughter, creating a palpably electric atmosphere for all involved, only to immediately cease when the teacher enters the classroom for the next lesson.

Ah, good times.. What was your favourite memory in primary school?
