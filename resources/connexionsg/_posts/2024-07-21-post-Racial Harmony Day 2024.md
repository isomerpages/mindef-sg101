<p>Today (21 July) is Racial Harmony Day. This day holds profound significance
for Singapore as it commemorates the racial riots of 1964, reminding us
of the importance of racial tolerance, understanding, and unity.</p>
<p>The Pew Research Study in 2022 found that Singapore is one of the most
religiously diverse countries in the world, with high levels of interreligious
tolerance and acceptance. This is indeed very precious. Through mutual
trust and understanding, our diversity can be a source of strength.</p>
<p>As Prime Minister Lawrence Wong said in his speech at his Swearing-In
Ceremony in May 2024, ‚ÄúSingapore has always been a diverse country ‚Äì many
races, many religions, many languages ‚Äì and more so now than before. We
have achieved this not by denying our differences, but by embracing them.
When issues arise between communities, and from time to time, they will
‚Äì we do not accentuate our differences. Instead, we accept them. So from
our diversity, we forge unity. From many, we become one united people,
regardless of race, language, or religion.‚Äù</p>
<p>Let this day not only be a celebration but also a poignant reminder of
the values we hold dear as Singaporeans - values of inclusivity, acceptance,
and the unwavering belief that diversity is our nation's greatest strength.</p>
<p>Happy Racial Harmony Day to all!</p>
