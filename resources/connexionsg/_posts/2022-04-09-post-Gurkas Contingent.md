#OnThisDay (9 Apr) in 1949, the Gurkha Contingent was formed. Known for their toughness, alertness, discipline, resilience, fearlessness, and professionalism, the Gurkhas have played a part in our security for many decades.

As a neutral force, they have helped to quell riots when communal tensions were high, such as the Maria Hertogh riots in 1950 and Hock Lee Bus riots in 1955. Today, they continue to augment the Singapore Police Force, guard selected installations, and provide security at major security events.

The Gurkhasâ€™ achievements are not without sacrifice. Although they are Nepalese, they come to Singapore as young as 18 years old, and return to Nepal after 15 to 20 years of service. Even before the pandemic, they go home only for a few weeks every three years. Their children who grow up here, attending our schools and absorbing our culture, may find themselves feeling like strangers in their own land when they return to Nepal.

The Gurkhas are part of our community, and they have contributed much in the course of their service. Their dedication and resilience are traits that we admire. Thank you.
