Harlequin Butterfly, though stunning, is a rare sight in Singapore's urban
landscape. Preferring heavily shaded areas within forests, this elusive
beauty is often found fluttering among the foliage near the forest floor,
with its wings half-opened, a sight to behold. But what truly sets it apart
is its unique feeding habits - it's not a nectar lover, but rather, it
seeks out microscopic substances on leaf surfaces.
<br>
<br>Beautiful yet very rare in Singapore, the Harlequin Butterfly's presence
is closely tied to the existence of its host plants in the forest. Sadly,
its local population is under serious threat. In fact, it was thought to
be locally extinct in the Singapore mainland, surviving only in Pulau Tekong,
until a colony was discovered on the mainland in 2006.
<br>
<br>Subtle differences between male and female Harlequin Butterflies add to
their allure and charm. Males are brownish-black above and unmarked. On
the forewing, there is a pale reddish-brown sub-apical patch. Females are
marked like the female of the Lesser Harlequin but without any dark-dusted
veins on the whitish sub-apical patch on the forewing. Underside of males
and females are reddish-brown, with pale, blue-edged black spots on both
wings.
<br>
<br>Today, the biggest threat to the survival of the Harlequin butterfly is
rapid deforestation, as lush forests crucial for the survival of the species
are cleared for urban projects and developments. With every tree cleared,
we risk losing this precious species forever.
<br>
<br>In our journey towards progress, let's remember to tread lightly on nature's
path. As Singapore progresses, we should continue to balance our development
needs with our natural environment, so that our island remains a place
that is liveable and sustainable for humans and wildlife alike.</p>
