One of the most famous battles during the Japanese invasion of Singapore was the Battle of Pasir Panjang, during which Lieutenant Adnan Saidi and men of the “C” company of the 1st Malay Brigade made a heroic last stand against the Japanese army despite being heavily outnumbered, and fought to their deaths.

In the aftermath of the battle, many of the regiment’s troopers were killed for refusing to remove their uniforms, embodying their regimental motto ‘Ta’at Setia’ (brave and true). Lt Adnan himself was said to have been hung under a cherry tree and bayoneted to death.

Today, a bronze sculpture of the Malay Regiment, aptly titled the Price of Peace, stands in the midst of the interpretive centre, Reflections at Bukit Chandu.

Built in remembrance of the heroic sacrifices of the Malay Regiment on the very hill, the sculpture simply displays a mortar crew kneeling around a mortar, with the soldier at the front with a raised hand, presumably about to give the order to fire in valiant defence of the ridge.

The sculpture is but one of the many attractions you may find at Reflections at Bukit Chandu -- within the centre, you will also uncover the history and equipment of the Malay Regiment, including bullets from the battle, footage of Lt Adnan’s ceremonial parade, and even bullet casings uncovered in 2019.

As Singapore continues to progress and thrive, may we also never forget the hardship and sacrifices that Singaporeans before us went through for the benefit of the country and its people -- for this is, indeed, the price of peace.
