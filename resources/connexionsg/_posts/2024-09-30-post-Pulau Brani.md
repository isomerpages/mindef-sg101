<p>Pulau Brani (“isle of the brave” in Malay) is an island located off the
southern coast of Singapore, near Keppel Harbour. In the 19th century,
it had a fort, a coal depot, tin smelting plant and a ship-repairing dock.
About 500 Malays and Chinese lived on the island until they were relocated
to the mainland in the 1960s. In 1974, Singapore’s first naval base, Brani
Naval Base, was officially opened on Pulau Brani. In 1992, Brani Terminal
commenced its first port operations on the island. Brani Naval Base formally
closed in 2000 as it moved to a larger site at Changi. Brani Terminal is
expected to move all its operations to Tuas Port by 2027.</p>
<p>Going forward, as part of a concerted effort to rejuvenate Singapore’s
southern coastline, there are plans for Pulau Brani and Sentosa to be redeveloped
for recreational and commercial uses under the Greater Sentosa Master Plan
(formerly known as Sentosa-Brani Master Plan). Proposals include restoring
natural habitats and wetland areas, including the coastal coral reefs between
Sentosa and Pulau Brani, to enhance marine sustainability. There are also
plans to redevelop the islands according to five zones. The vibrant and
beachfront clusters will have themed attractions for families. The island
heart cluster is the centre of the entire development and will have indoor
and outdoor attractions. Pulau Brani’s city-facing waterfront will retain
its port architecture to commemorate Singapore’s port heritage and feature
a futuristic discovery park. Nature lovers can enjoy the ridgeline, which
will offer nature and heritage attractions connecting Mount Faber, Pulau
Brani, Mount Serapong and Mount Imbiah to Fort Siloso.</p>
