Not too long ago, computer labs were a mainstay in our school environment. üñ•‚å®

The advent of personal computers in the 1990s had opened a whole new realm of possibilities for us: as a small island with no natural resources, mastering the use of Information Technology would enhance Singapore‚Äôs international competitiveness, upgrade our workforce, and grow the stature of our nation.

To further promote IT literacy among our young, primary and secondary school students had dedicated IT lessons at the computer laboratory (‚Äúcomputer lab‚Äù). During these sessions, students learnt how to write essays and create presentations using Microsoft applications. As they progressed in their education level, they were further exposed to website creation and design, animation, and java script.

These computer lab lessons held the allure of exploring new technology, as well as the comfort of working in air-conditioned labs, always a much-needed reprieve in our humid Singapore weather!

Why did you like your computer lab lessons, and what was the most memorable thing you did then?
