<p>Before the government acquired it in 1972, Coney Island, also known as
Pulau Serangoon, had multiple owners from the 1930s. From the 1930s to
1940s, Aw Boon Haw and Aw Boon Par, the brothers behind the Tiger Balm
brand, transformed the original 13-hectare island into a resort called
Haw Par Island. They built a 600-square-metre bungalow, which still stands
today in the central part of Coney Island as the Haw Par Beach Villa. In
1950, businessman Ghulam Mahmood purchased the island from the brothers
in a bid to develop Singapore’s first “island health resort”, introducing
leisure activities to Coney Island such as swimming, boating, skating rinks
and even cottages for honeymooners and family holidays. But just three
years later, the island was up for auction. The island was later owned
by a Thai businessman who tried to sell Coney Island without success.</p>
<p>After acquiring Coney Island with the intention to develop it, the government
announced plans to transform it into a recreation destination. However,
leisure activities were limited to camping and fishing due to the inconvenience
to reach Coney Island - visitors had to take a half-hour boat ride from
Punggol Point to reach the island. Worsened by both sea and air pollution,
public’s interest in Coney Island dwindled.</p>
<p>In the 1980s, the government’s vision to further connect Coney Island
to the mainland met with resistance due to worries of the island losing
its natural charm. It was only in the 1990s that the southern part of Coney
Island was extended as part of the Punggol 21 plan, which included the
creation of a park. In doing so, the channel between Punggol and Coney
Island narrowed from 200 to 100 meters, and the body of water created was
converted into Serangoon Reservoir in 2007.</p>
<p>Fast forward to today, Coney Island spans 100 hectares, seven times its
original area! The park is built on principles of environmental sustainability,
featuring zero-energy, solar-powered toilets that use rainwater for flushing
and hand washing, and park structures such as benches and boardwalks made
from recycled Casuarina timber. Additionally, the island's five beaches
and greenery were left uncleared to encourage natural growth, resulting
in an increasingly abundant biodiversity. Look out for critically endangered
species, such as the spotted wood-owl and black-crowned night-heron, and
spot migratory birds at one of the island’s five bird-watching hides!</p>
<p>As a vibrant and ecological sustainable green space rich in biodiversity,
Coney Island is an example of how nature can be anyone’s playground. Whether
you are visiting as a family, a fitness enthusiast, a photographer, or
perhaps even a birdwatcher, there is bound to be an activity for you! Rent
a bike, take a slow walk through the dense canopy, and maybe even take
some ethereal photos at the lalang field in the park! These interactions
show the symbiotic relationship between humans and nature, where we rely
on nature's resources and help sustain it in return.</p>
<p>What are some actions we can take to protect this relationship? For example,
families can teach children the importance of conservation during their
visits, instilling respect for the environment at a young age. Photographers
and birdwatchers not only capture the beauty of the island but can also
use this opportunity to raise awareness of its ecological value through
their work. Individuals can also volunteer for basic gardening skills to
enhance the greenery in Coney Island Park.</p>
<p>Our use of Coney Island for recreation, education, and relaxation illustrates
how urban development and natural preservation can coexist. It is a reflection
of our respect for nature and commitment to build a liveable and sustainable
spaces even as we develop the urban environment.</p>
<p>As Singapore continues to intensify nature in our parks, every individual’s
support and involvement count. How do we wish to coexist sustainably with
nature, and what can we do as individuals to ensure harmony between the
natural and built environment?
