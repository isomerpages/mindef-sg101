#TIL that 8.7% of the Singapore population met the criteria for clinical depression, while 9.4% met the criteria for anxiety, a 2021 study by the Institute of Mental Health (IMH) of over 1,000 Singapore citizens and permanent residents found. Another study in 2022 also found that one in three young people in Singapore reported internalising mental health symptoms such as sadness, anxiety and loneliness, and one in six reported experiencing externalising mental health symptoms such as hyperactivity and aggression. This study by the National University of Singapore, in collaboration with the Education Ministry and IMH, was the first national study to estimate the prevalence of mental health conditions of youth, as well as gauge their emotional resilience.

Mental health issues are complex and can arise from a combination of factors. According to the World Health Organisation (WHO), some common factors contributing to mental health issues may include: genetics, environmental stressors such as pressure from academics or work, peer pressure, bullying, a lack of access to support, and a lack of effective coping mechanisms.

Fortunately, mental health conditions can be managed with the right treatment and support, and those living with mental health struggles can continue to lead fulfilling lives, and make meaningful contributions to our community.

To improve the mental health ecosystem where people with mental health needs can seek help without stigma and are readily supported for their recovery, an inter-agency taskforce launched Singapore‚Äôs National Mental Health and Well-being strategy on 5 Oct 2023. The strategy ‚Äì encompassing both ongoing and planned whole-of-government, whole-of-society efforts ‚Äì will focus on four focus areas; (1) expanding capacity of mental health services, (2) enhancing capabilities of service providers for early identification and intervention, (3) promoting mental health and well-being; and (4) improving workplace mental health and well-being. The strategy will tackle mental health issues coherently and holistically, from both preventive and curative perspectives, and through schools, community, and workplaces. Ultimately, we need a whole-of-society approach to tackle mental health issues and improve the well-being of our population.     

Today, the 10th Oct, on World Mental Health Day, let's Break the Silence, end the stigma, help ourselves and support one another in our mental health journeys. üåç‚ù§Ô∏èüíö

Together, we can create a culture of compassion and kindness in Singapore.
