Singapore’s peaceful diversity did not come easily and was almost literally achieved with blood, sweat, and tears.  

There were periods in our history where racial tensions escalated to full-blown conflict with lives lost and property destroyed during the 1950 Maria Hertogh riots and the 1964 communal riots.  

Today, through legislation, education, and grassroots efforts, large-scale racial disputes and riots are nearly eliminated. But many minorities in Singapore are still dealing with casual and overt racism at the individual level.  

Last year during Racial Harmony Day, Kindness SG published an opinion piece titled "Do we really need a Racial Harmony Day in Singapore”?  
Here are some thought-provoking insights from the piece.
