<p>At Islanders’ Day on 14 June this year, many braved the heat at West Coast
Park to celebrate the culture and stories of Singapore’s coastal communities
that once lived off the land and sea. From the martial arts of Pulau Sudong
to the rhythmic Joget Dangkong dance, participants got a glimpse into the
lives of these former offshore islanders.</p>
<p>As many of these former islanders were very young when they were relocated
to the mainland for national development in the 1970s, there is now a sense
of urgency to record and preserve the disappearing memories and heritage
of these seafaring folk.</p>
<p>Initiatives such as this festival are important to help Singaporeans understand
our diverse heritage and strengthen our unique multicultural identity as
Singapore continues to progress.</p>
