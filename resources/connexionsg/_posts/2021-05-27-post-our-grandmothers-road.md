There are more than 3,200 streets in Singapore. Their names not only help us locate places efficiently but also reflect Singapore’s heritage.

With 2021 designated as the Year of Celebrating SG Women, the first post of the series #StreetsOfSingapore looks at streets named after women.

It turns out there are only 41 such streets, mostly named after British royalty or female family members of early prominent Singaporeans and residents. For example, Queensway was named after Queen Elizabeth II and Eng Neo Avenue after Mdm Tan Eng Neo, the wife of businessman Gaw Boon Chan. Some are named after women pioneers, such as Mdm Hajijah Cemat and Sophia Blackmore.

Why are there just 41 “female” names out of 3,200 streets? Were women less prominent back then? The difference in visibility is so stark today, where women from all walks of life are making their presence felt and their voices heard, through multiple platforms in social media, work and beyond. By finding powerful ways to amplify their voice, women in Singapore are asserting more influence in shaping society than ever before, expanding the pathways their early pioneers had paved.
