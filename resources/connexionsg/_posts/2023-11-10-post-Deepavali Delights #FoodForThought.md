ü™î‚ú® As Singapore lights up with the magic of Deepavali, we not only look forward to the visual spectacle but also the symphony of Deepavali snacks.

1. Murukku Magic
Murukku, an all-time favourite Indian snack, steals the spotlight during Deepavali. Loved by all, it transcends cultural boundaries and brings us together. Crafted from a harmonious blend of rice flour, urad dal (black lentil), and a rich medley of spices, they are shaped into intricate spirals and then deep fried. 'Murukku' comes from the Tamil word for 'twisted', referring to its shape. It comes in twisted spirals, puffed pillows, sticks or even ribbons. In Singapore, they often take on innovative flavours like salted egg yolk and seaweed!

2. Burfi Bliss
Deepavali wouldn‚Äôt be complete without this iconic snack. These sweet, milk-based confections come in a delightful array of flavours, ranging from classic cardamom and pistachio to modern twists such as chocolate and matcha. In Singapore, the pink and white diamonds of coconut Burfi, locally known as coconut candy, evoke a sense of nostalgia, as some families traditionally start their meals on Deepavali with something sweet to signify a good beginning.

As we savour these treats, we hope that everyone finds the time to bond with family and friends this Deepavali. What other Deepavali snacks set your heart aflutter? Share your favourites with us in the comments! üç¨
