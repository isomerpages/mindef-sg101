What should you do when you see a crocodile 🐊 in public? 😱

Before you dismiss the notion, #didyouknow that Singapore has a resident population of Estuarine Crocodiles? These giant reptiles have been occasionally spotted in water bodies or lounging on land, basking in the sun (they enjoy a good tan too!).

Growing up to 6 metres in length and weighing as much as 1,000 kilograms, the Estaurine Crocodile is one of the largest crocodile species in the world! They are usually found in mangrove swamps, mudflats, and estuaries near the coast and hunt mainly at night, feeding mostly on fish but also mammals, birds, and dead animals. Where they are commonly found, warning signs are posted at such areas advising the public not to venture off the designated paths.

Sadly, these majestic creatures, which have been here for thousands of years, came under threat when Singapore’s rapid urbanisation led to widespread destruction of its habitats. The presence of this ancient species in the few remaining pockets of mangroves left untouched, are indicators of a healthy ecology. Indeed, as we progress, let us remember that there is always a cost that is borne by nature and wildlife, and we must indeed have their interests at heart as well (yes, even if they are large, fearsome apex predators).

And if you see one, for goodness’ sake, do NOT approach it. Instead, stay calm and back away, and MAYBE admire them from a very safe distance! 😵‍💫
