#TIL Today I Learnt that Kintsugi (golden repair) is a Japanese pottery repair method that dates back more than 400 years. In Singapore, there are classes we can take to learn this. It is an art that embraces flaws and imperfections, turning cracks into golden “scars” that make the pottery even more unique, stronger and more beautiful than before. A concept worth remembering, because it demonstrates resilience.

When things get broken, we can carefully fix them, and in the process, achieve something more valuable and #EvenBetter than before.

We did this when we built our own defence forces, after Singapore fell during the war. We did this when we made the world our hinterland, after separation from Malaysia. We did this when we developed ways to bring infections down, after the SARS pandemic hit us. We do this every time we improve old systems, repair relationships, restore confidence after setbacks.

When bad things happen, they can be turned into opportunities to do even better. Like kintsugi. What "golden repairs" have you also done in your life?
