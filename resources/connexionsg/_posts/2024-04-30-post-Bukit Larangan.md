<p>üì∑: Fort Canning Hill (Source: NParks)</p>
<p>Bukit Larangan (or ‚ÄúForbidden Hill‚Äù in Malay), Government Hill, Bukit
Tuan Bonham, Bukit Bendera, Singapore Hill ‚Äì Fort Canning Hill has had
many names over the years.
<br>
<br>At slightly more than 60 metres high and located at the junction of Canning
Rise and Fort Canning Road in Singapore‚Äôs Central Business District, the
history of Fort Canning Hill dates back to the 14th century when Singapore
(then known as Temasek), was a regional trading centre. Prior to Raffles‚Äô
landing in Singapore in 1819, few dared venture up the ‚Äúforbidden hill‚Äù
as it was believed to be the burial ground of the last king Iskandar Shah.
In 1822, Raffles built his first residence on the hill, which became home
to subsequent colonial governors until late 1859 when the residence was
demolished and replaced by a fort, named Fort Canning after then-governor
Charles John Canning. While the fort has since been demolished, never having
been used in the defence of Singapore, remnants of the Fort Gate still
stand as testimony of the old fort today. In 1981, the hill was renamed
Fort Canning Park with the planting of a fruit tree by Founding Prime Minister
Lee Kuan Yew.
<br>
<br>Fort Canning Hill also witnessed key historic events, including the inception
of Singapore‚Äôs first Botanic Gardens and the surrender of Singapore to
the Japanese by Lieutenant-General Arthur Percival.
<br>
<br>Today, the 18-hectare park is a popular destination with tourists and
Singaporeans alike due to its historical significance and lush natural
beauty. Visitors can explore the many landmarks and national monuments
that were constructed around Fort Canning Hill including, the Fort Gate,
Battle Box and the Old Hill Street Police Station. New spaces such as the
Fort Canning Heritage Gallery, themed gardens and the Fort Canning Green,
a lawn with its lush green gentle slopes, makes it a perfect venue to unwind
too.
<br>
<br>The unique combination of historical relics and lush greenery lends Fort
Canning Hill a special place in the hearts of Singaporeans.
