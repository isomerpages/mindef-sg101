<p>Search for “Yishun” on Google and you may land on wacky search results
such as “Is Yishun dangerous?”; “Is Yishun a bad place?”; or—perhaps a
reflection of our fascination (or fear) of the supernatural—“Is Yishun
haunted?”.</p>
<p>Indeed, Yishun seems to be the locale of a disproportionate number of
unusual occurrences. Further fuelled by online memes and chatter, it is
not surprising that Yishun has earned itself quite a self-reinforcing loop
of notoriety among Singaporeans. More recently, even a crocodile was spotted
in Yishun Dam -- perhaps to check out the hype surrounding Yishun? 🤔</p>
<p>However, beyond sensational reports and stories, Yishun finds itself like
other suburban towns in Singapore that have undergone multiple winds of
change over the years.</p>
<p>Yishun is named after Lim Nee Soon (pronounced “Yi Shun” in Mandarin),
a Singapore-born plantation owner and community leader who lived during
the turn of the 20th century. Also known as the ‘Rubber and Pineapple King’,
he was a caring landlord who took care of many villagers who worked for
him. Those who worked for him eventually formed a village settlement, then
known as Nee Soon village.</p>
<p>Yishun remained populated by farms and villages until urbanisation in
the area began in 1976 with the construction of Yishun New Town. By 1986,
Yishun was a modern satellite town, housing more than 110,000 residents.
Its connectivity to the rest of Singapore was further enhanced after Yishun
MRT station was completed in 1988.</p>
<p>Over the years, Yishun’s urban development came in full swing, with more
housing developments and estates built. Lifestyle amenities such as parks,
hawker centres, heritage trails, the SAFRA Yishun clubhouse, and even water
sports at Lower Seletar Reservoir also sprung into existence over the years.
At one point, Yishun was also home to the biggest multiplex cinema in the
whole of Asia! Unsurprisingly, Yishun soon became a popular destination
for Singaporeans to live and play in!</p>
<p>Due to the need to cater for its ageing population, significant thought
was also put into healthcare and eldercare planning in the town. Khoo Teck
Puat Hospital (KTPH) was completed in 2010, while Yishun Community Hospital
(YCH) was opened in 2015 as an integrated healthcare development as part
of KTPH. Together, KTPH and YCH provides a full suite of healthcare options
for patients of varying conditions. Two new nursing homes will soon be
added to Yishun as well.</p>
<p>Yishun also holds the honour of being designated Singapore’s first “dementia-friendly”
neighbourhood, with grassroots and municipal efforts to help those living
with dementia navigate safely and easily within the community.</p>
<p>From humble beginnings to a modern town and to one of Singapore’s largest
and all-encompassing living districts today, Yishun’s growth is a microcosm
of our country’s development. Today, Yishun stands proudly as one of the
largest and most vibrant towns of our Singapore, and encapsulates a positive
and lasting legacy for generations of Singaporeans to come.</p>
