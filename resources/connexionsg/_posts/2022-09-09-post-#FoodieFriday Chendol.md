Enjoyed across Southeast Asia, the chendol is commonly made of shaved ice, pea noodles, palm sugar (“gula melaka”), and coconut milk, with some variations.  
  
It is also in our national cuisine and well-loved by Singaporeans across all walks of life, especially if doused in generous amounts of smooth, creamy coconut milk, and rich, smoky liquid gula melaka. On top of freshly-made pea noodles and red beans, some chendol vendors have even put a quintessentially Singaporean spin by adding a scoop of durian — the ultimate topping to lure us Singaporeans from near and far! 😋
