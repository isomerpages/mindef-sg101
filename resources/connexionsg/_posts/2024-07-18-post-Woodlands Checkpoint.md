Woodlands Checkpoint (WCP) opened in 1999 and is into its 25th year of
operations now. One of three land checkpoints in Singapore (the other two
being the Tuas Checkpoint and the Woodlands Train Checkpoint), the WCP
has been a crucial link for commuters and goods traveling between Singapore
and Malaysia, serving as the primary land crossing between the two nations.
Thousands of people, including workers, students, and tourists pass through
the WCP daily.</p>
<p>The WCP is â€˜notoriousâ€™ for its chronic congestion. Compared to about 230,000
travellers daily in 2000, the daily traveller volume has increased to about
300,000 daily today, with this number often going higher during long weekends
and holidays. By 2050, the number of travellers passing through WCP is
projected to reach 400,000 a day!</p>
<p>Over the years, there have been various efforts to increase efficiency
and experience of immigration clearance without compromising the security
of our borders. However, there are inherent constraints such as limited
space and infrastructure to address the persistent traffic congestion.
As such, the WCP will be undergoing a 10 to 15-year long redevelopment
from 2025, including land reclamation, to ensure a more sustainable and
long-term solution to the chronic congestion at this land crossing.</p>
<p>The first phase of the redevelopment, which comprises an extension at
the Old Woodlands Town Centre (OWTC) and Bukit Timah Expressway, is expected
to start in 2025, and is targeted to be completed progressively from 2028.
Following this, the old WCP will be demolished, redeveloped, and integrated
with the OWTC extension, which is expected to be fully operational from
2032.</p>
<p>When fully redeveloped, the WCP will be approximately five times the size
of the current WCP! One can look forward to reducing average checkpoint
clearance time from 60 minutes to 15 minutes during peak periods across
all vehicle types!</p>
<p>From manual checks through open counters in 1960s to using QR code technology
at self-help counters today, the WCP is a testament of Singaporeâ€™s spirit
of continuous innovation and forward-thinking culture.</p>
