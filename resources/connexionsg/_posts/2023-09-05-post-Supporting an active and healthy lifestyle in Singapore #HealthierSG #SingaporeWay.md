Singapore is an aged society; soon to be a ‚Äúsuper-aged‚Äù society ‚Äî one of the fastest-ageing nations in the world. PM Lee pointed this out during his National Day Rally this year.
One in five Singaporeans is a senior, aged 65 and above. By 2030, nearly one in four Singaporeans will be a senior. This will have massive social and economic impact for Singapore.
Our #SingaporeWay of enhancing quality of life as we age is the conscious practice of healthy living. In 1992, the Ministry of Health introduced the National Healthy Lifestyle Programme to encourage and empower Singaporeans across all age groups to take personal responsibility for our own health and practise healthy living habits. This includes keeping physically active and mentally positive, maintaining a balanced diet and going for regular health screenings.
In the programme‚Äôs early days, a range of activities, events and awards were organised to promote the cause, including the #GreatSingaporeWorkout, an aerobic routine introduced in 1993. Attended by 26,107 participants, the inaugural session on 3 October was held at the Padang and later inscribed in the Guinness Book of Records as the largest mass aerobic session held at one location.
As lifestyle and health needs evolved, the government increased the accessible and affordable healthy living options that Singaporeans could include in our daily regimen. We have free access to public exercise stations and classes in neighbourhoods and near workplaces. Food operators are subsidised for using healthier ingredients and offering healthier menus. Food labels are placed on items with lesser fat and sodium content. By December 2023, all beverages sold in Singapore will come with mandatory labelling as a measure to reduce the country‚Äôs sugar intake. Singaporeans can also make use of healthy lifestyle tools such as the Healthy 365 mobile app to access information, and track daily activities and food intake. Singapore's #NationalStepsChallenge is the world‚Äôs first population level fitness tracker-based physical activity initiative that encourages and rewards Singaporeans to move more.
In July 2023, the government launched #HealthierSG, a national initiative by the Ministry of Health (MOH) focusing on preventive care. The aim is to encourage proactive steps to prevent the onset of chronic diseases. Healthier SG will roll out in phases, to anchor individuals with a family doctor and community programmes to stay active and healthy. The programme represents a new social compact where the government and people work together to take proactive steps, with preventive care being key to living long and well. So that we can take Singapore forward, as a healthier and happier people.
