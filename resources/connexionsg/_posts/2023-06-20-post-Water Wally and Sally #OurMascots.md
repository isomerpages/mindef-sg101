As a water-stressed country with no natural water resources, Singapore needs our people to understand the importance of water conservation and reducing water wastage. The Singapore Public Utilities Board (PUB) introduced Water Wally in 2005 to put a face to water management, so that our public, especially our young, can relate to the issues.

Water Wally first appeared as giant balloons suspended over reservoirs and canals around Singapore, in conjunction with a ‚ÄúWhere‚Äôs Wally‚Äù-inspired contest to spot the mascot. Shaped as a blue water droplet, Water Wally has since appeared in various educational materials, events and campaigns.

At the 2007 National Day Parade, he was featured in five different NEWater bottle designs and tattoos, given out to participants as part of the NDP fun pack. In 2009, PUB created the first-ever TV short animation series featuring Water Wally and his friends titled, ‚ÄúThe Adventures of Water Wally‚Äù to engage children between six and ten years old.

In 2013, PUB developed the Water Wally Shower Dance video to remind Singaporeans to keep their showers under five minutes. However, the video made waves online for a scene where Water Wally walked in as a boy was showering: netizens commented that the scene was inappropriate. In 2014, Water Wally made waves again for partnering with pretty, female influencers. In 2015, Water Wally returned with a more family-oriented messaging.

PUB fine-tuned their engagement further by introducing Wally‚Äôs sister Sally in 2020, described as "well-traveled" and "social-media savvy‚Äù with knowledge and experience on water sustainability across different mediums. The Water Wally and Sally Club was launched that year for kids aged 12 years and below, to learn about climate change and water-related topics. In 2021, PUB developed a dance-along music video with the Baby Shark family titled Turn off the Tap! featuring Water Wally and Sally. In the video, Water Wally and Sally encourage children to turn off the tap while soaping, shampooing and brushing their teeth. Baby Shark x PUB was a hit.

With their cute, round shapes, Water Wally and Sally bring a cheerful optimism to the challenge of managing Singapore‚Äôs water resources, as they seek to educate our young in fun and interactive ways.
