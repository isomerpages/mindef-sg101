<p>Did you know that Singapore EXPO is the largest purpose-built meetings,
incentives, conventions and exhibitions (MICE) venue in Singapore? It was
officially opened on 4 March 1999 at a time when business travel and MICE
was identified as one of the key drivers of tourism in Singapore.
<br>
<br>The MICE industry attracts thousand of delegates, exhibitors and speakers
from around the world, creating a platform for economic growth and development.
As part of the tourism sector, MICE industry contributed nearly 1% of Singapore’s
GDP before COVID 19.

<br>Today, Singapore EXPO is one of the largest exhibition centres in Southeast
Asia and continues to be a key MICE venue. Swipe to learn more about Singapore
