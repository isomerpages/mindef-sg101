<p>On Pasir Panjang Hill lies Haw Par Villa, a cultural park where generations
of Singaporeans have visited over the decades.</p>
<p>Elevated and facing the sea, the site was regarded as so fortuitous that
brothers Aw Boon Haw and Aw Boon Par — developers of Tiger Balm products
— bought the land in 1935, when they relocated here from Myanmar. A fabulous
Art Deco villa was built, but was bombed by the Japanese during World War
II, and then demolished after the war ended. From the 1940s to the 1970s,
the Aw family filled the sprawling grounds with figurines, heralded by
an archway guarded by a tiger (‘haw’ in Chinese dialect) and a leopard
(‘par’ in Chinese dialect). The 'pool' had mermaids, stone renditions of
wildlife including rhinoceros, kangaroos, and gorillas were scattered across
caves and grottos. 1,000 statues and 150 colourful dioramas depicted Chinese
folklore with a moral edge, including the 'Ten Courts of Hell' where souls
were punished for crimes, in gory detail. Aw Boon Par’s son, Aw Cheng Chye,
added global icons such as the Statue of Liberty, to reflect his passion
for travel. Known as Tiger Balm Gardens in the early years, the park was
free to the public, drawing in thousands who marvelled at the scenes.</p>
<p>In 1985, Singapore Tourism Board (STB) took over management of the park,
and began revitalisation work to boost tourism. Renamed as Dragon World,
with boat rides, theatres, and special effects, it was marketed as a Chinese
mythological theme park and charged admission fees. In 2001, Dragon World
ceased operations, the dragon was removed, and the grounds reverted to
a free public park.</p>
<p>In 2015, STB contracted heritage-based travel company, Journeys, to manage
the place. In 2021, the park was enhanced with night lighting and extensive
conservation work the statues. The Ten Courts of Hell became part of an
upgraded and expanded Hell’s Museum, which houses an indoor gallery depicting
death and the afterlife across different religions. Hell’s Museum charges
admission fees but the park retains its free entry.</p>
<p>Cultural events enliven the space and ticketed guided tours, such as ‘Tiger
Tiger Burning Bright’, fill in the details on the Aw family, the origins
of both Tiger Balm and Haw Par Villa. Their stories of turbulent tragedies
and meteoric rises to success add further layers to this memorable place.</p>
<p>Haw Par Villa remains an important #heritage park for Singaporeans to
learn about Chinese culture, where visitors can wander in free, to wonder
at the visions of a legendary Singapore family.</p>

<p>In the 1980s, Haw Par Villa was an early form of “edu-tainment” for Singaporean
parents. A must-visit family outing where its most iconic attraction –
The Ten Courts of Hell – had a vivid way of telling cautionary tales. Set
inside a dark space, the statues in the Ten Courts of Hell preached messages
of morals and Confucian ethics as well as Chinese mythology. And their
gory stories left many Singaporean kids scared - and scarred - into behaving
better.</p>
<p>Today, the Ten Courts of Hell is part of an upgraded and expanded Hell’s
Museum, which houses an indoor gallery depicting death and the afterlife
across religions. The depictions of horrible punishment for bad behaviours
are all there.</p>
<p>But do parents today still think it’s a good way to teach kids to behave?
Is visualising all that torture an effective method or is it a case of,
uhm, overkill? #GoneOrOn?</p>
