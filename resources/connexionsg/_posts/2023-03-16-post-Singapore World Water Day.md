Every year, the PUB, Singapore's National Water Agency, runs the Singapore World Water Day campaign for the whole of March to remind Singaporeans to conserve water. Globally, the UN’s annual World Water Day is commemorated on 22 March.

The need for reminders to save water gets stronger the easier our access to clean water. In Singapore, we get drinkable water from home taps at all times even though we are one of the most water-stressed countries in the world with our lack of natural fresh water resources and storage space.

In fact, a few decades ago, Singaporeans had to draw their water from wells dotting the city, including ones on Ann Siang Hill, Sembawang and Upper Serangoon, or dig up their own wells in the kampong. People had to trek to the wells, fill heavy buckets, and return on uneven, muddy terrain back home. Some also gathered at the wells to do laundry, take baths, and brush their teeth.

It took years for the Singapore Rural Board and City Water Department in the 1950s to lay water mains to rural areas, starting with Changi, Loyang and Jurong. While there were 2,426 standpipes in the villages by 1963, these were shared amongst several families. Even into the 1970s, some Singaporeans in rural areas still relied on wells.

Today, clean water is everywhere in Singapore. Our hotels and condos come with pools or jacuzzis, our homes run washing machines and flush toilets with drinkable water, our gyms and some offices include shower facilities. Singapore’s Four National Taps are sustained with water from local catchments, imported water, high-grade reclaimed water known as NEWater and desalinated water. We have overcome our lack of fresh water resources to meet the needs of our growing nation.

It is easy to forget that clean water is not easily accessible to many people around the world. And that just as every drop of water counts, all our efforts count in saving water and making water conservation a way of life. So, here’s a reminder to think of W-A-T-E-R when we use water.
