<p>Singapore’s Olympic endeavour began at the London Olympics 1948 with one
athlete, Lloyd Valberg, in the high jump event. Since then, our athletes
have competed in almost every edition of the Games, demonstrating values
of sportsmanship, excellence and resilience. <a href="https://www.facebook.com/hashtag/onthisday?__eep__=6&amp;__cft__[0]=AZUYWshx4I17ajaAgONSXQj5zmF73T9zb9EFmDDJLq5bdJPBEKumLRHqHh7gPlQ9toJEe5L5d0Gp4trLztDkaaTHzMyXOonoCMhYEIthdzgw4v9IxvmjfNwAgfaku7C6Ob4AhGxL3g0-EVBzapmu7FU3ij5SNSwKVtMEYttl8j0B_C56x7aTd63gholPrp42e3k&amp;__tn__=*NK-R" class="x1i10hfl xjbqb8w x1ejq31n xd10rxx x1sy0etr x17r0tee x972fbf xcfux6l x1qhh985 xm0m39n x9f619 x1ypdohk xt0psk2 xe8uvvx xdj266r x11i5rnm xat24cr x1mh8g0r xexx8yu x4uap5 x18d9i69 xkhd6sd x16tdsg8 x1hl2dhg xggy1nq x1a2a7pz x1sur9pj xkrqix3 x1fey0fg xo1l8bm" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">#OnThisDay</a> (8
Sep) 64 years ago, Tan Howe Liang won Singapore’s first Olympic medal,
finishing second amongst thirty-three competitors in the lightweight category
of the weightlifting event at the 1960 Rome Olympics.</p>
<p>Tan cultivated a love for weightlifting after watching a competition at
the amusement park. After only training for a year on his own, he won the
National Junior and Senior Weightlifting Championship titles in the lightweight
division in 1953. He participated for the first time and finished ninth
at the 1956 Melbourne Olympics but that did not stop him. At the 1958 Commonwealth
and Empire Games, he set a world record in the clean-and-jerk in the lightweight
category with a lift of 157kg.</p>
<p>The 10-hour competition at the Rome Olympics was a gruelling test of strength
and courage for Tan. Despite suffering cramps in both thighs and was advised
to seek medical treatment before his clean-and-jerk attempt, Tan powered
on to lift 155kg, which broke the existing Olympic record by 5kg. He recorded
a total weight of 380kg to win a silver and Singapore’s first Olympic medal.</p>
<p>Since then, Singapore has gone on to win a total of six medals at the
Olympics – one gold, two silvers and three bronzes. The women’s table tennis
team of Li Jiawei, Feng Tianwei and Wang Yuegu won a silver at Beijing
2008 before bagging a bronze at London 2012, where Feng also won an individual
bronze medal. Joseph Schooling won Singapore’s first historic gold medal
in the 100m butterfly swimming event at 2016 Rio de Janeiro Olympics. Kitefoiler
Maximilian Maeder clinched a bronze, Singapore’s sixth medal, at the latest
Paris Olympics.</p>
