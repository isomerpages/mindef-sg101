Located just off the north-east coast of Singapore, Pulau Ubin is one of Singapore’s last remaining villages or kampongs.

Home to only a small population of around 38 villagers today, Pulau Ubin was formerly a granite quarrying hub with close to 4,000 villagers in the 1970s before its transition into a popular getaway destination today.

With its small size of approximately 10 sqkm, you can easily get around Pulau Ubin via taxi, cycling or walking. The abundance of bicycle shops on Pulau Ubin makes cycling one of the more popular ways of getting to the most scenic spots on the island. Spot some wildlife and enjoy the tranquillity of the island as you keep an eye out for hornbills, wild boars, and monkeys.

You can also book a kayaking tour and let the experienced guide take you kayaking amongst the mangroves in Pulau Ubin. Apart from the mangroves, you can also see the traditional stilt houses or kelongs that are littered around the island.

The Chek Jawa Wetlands is another popular attraction on Pulau Ubin, with it being a unique natural area, where six major ecosystems – sandy beach, rocky beach, seagrass lagoon, coral rubble, mangroves, and coastal forest - meet!

If you’d like to stay longer on the island, you may even register your stay with the officials at the Pulau Ubin Police Post to pitch a tent at any of the three camping sites: (1) Endut Senin; (2) Jelutong; and (3) Mamam.

Whether it’s for an overnight camping trip or a short getaway, Pulau Ubin has much to offer! 🚶🏻 🛶 🏕️ 🌊

P/s: There are no ATMs on the island and only cash payments are accepted. Do make sure to withdraw sufficient money before heading off to the island.
