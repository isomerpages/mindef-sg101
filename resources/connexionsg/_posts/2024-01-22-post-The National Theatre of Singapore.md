National Theatre? An architectural gem that stood for 21 years, uniting
diverse cultures through the magic of the performing arts. Opened on 8
August 1963, the National Theatre is an open-air theatre with a cantilever
roof. Architect Alfred Wong's design featured a five-pointed faÃ§ade, with
no side or rear walls. In May 1965, a fountain designed by the Public Works
Department was built outside the National Theatre, as part of a programme
to beautify Singapore with fountains. From traditional opera to modern
drama, the theatre echoed the heartbeat of our nation.</p>
<p>The National Theatre was eventually closed in 1984 after more than two
decades of operation. Today, its spirit lives on in the Esplanade â€“ Theatres
on the Bay, a more modern and larger performing arts venue that became
a prominent cultural landmark in Singapore. The Esplanade officially opened
in 2002, marking a new chapter in Singapore's commitment to the arts and
cultural development.</p>
