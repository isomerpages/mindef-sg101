It takes a good eye to spot the Cinnamon Bush Frog aka the Spotted Tree Frog, which lives in the Bukit Timah and Central Catchment Nature Reserves in Singapore. It’s not only nocturnal but it is also really small — adults grow up to only four centimetres in length, smaller than a human thumb.

These tiny frogs can be identified by the small white spots on their bright orange or reddish brown body and limbs. Their scientific name is Nyctixalus Pictus and they are classified as vulnerable in Singapore due their small population size and habitat disturbance. Home is the low vegetation of primary forests and they have been seen perching on the leaves of shrubs and small trees about one to three metres above ground.

Unlike most frogs, the Cinnamon Bush Frogs lay eggs in tree cavities, which are considered a rare microhabitat in Singapore’s rainforests. They can also breed in old pitcher plants and their tadpoles have been found in old hollow fruit containing water.

After research revealed that the Cinnamon Bush Frog could be enticed to breed in artificial containers placed in suitable environments, the National Parks Board (@nparksbuzz) translocated tadpoles of this species to sites in the Botanic Gardens in December 2017. The effort to expand their distribution worked! Within a few months, the tiny frogs started breeding — a positive development in protecting these vulnerable species in Singapore.
