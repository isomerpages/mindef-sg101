With his rounded face and rounded body, National Day Parade (NDP) mascot, August, has an all-rounded charm, appealing to Singaporeans young and old since his re-introduction in 2021.

August is a male Merlion born on 9 Aug 2009. The 10-year-old Merlion - a redesign of an older NDP mascot from 2009 - is the work of full-time national serviceman, Corporal (NS) Royston Lim. As part of his makeover, August was given heart-shaped scales and a pair of rounded arms to make him appear more approachable.

He has a strong love for Singapore, as evident by his red T-shirt with the slogan “I heart SG”. August takes immense pride in being a Singaporean who enjoys local cuisine, scenery, and music, just like many of us. His interest in Singapore's history sometimes takes him to various historical spots of Singapore.

August's heart is always open to friendship, he has strong relationships with our other national mascots, such as Sharity Elephant, Merli and Nila.
