<p>Today (3 July), we remember the birth of our sixth President, Mr. S R
Nathan.</p>
<p>Mr Nathan was our longest-serving President, holding office for two terms
from 1999 to 2011. During his presidency, he championed numerous social
causes and was particularly known for initiating the President’s Challenge,
an annual series of charity events that raised millions for the less fortunate.
Even after his presidency, he remained active in the public sphere. He
frequently spoke at conferences, universities, and public forums, where
he shared his insights on leadership, governance, and social issues, inspiring
many individuals.</p>
<p>Besides making significant contributions to the nation throughout his
long and distinguished career, Mr Nathan was a strong advocate for racial
and religious harmony, consistently promoting social cohesion and understanding
among Singapore’s diverse communities.</p>
<p>He was also a strong advocate for youth development, encouraging young
Singaporeans to engage in nation-building activities and community service.</p>
<p>As we reflect on his contributions to Singapore, let us continue to embrace
his vision of a united Singapore and continue to build a society that is
harmonious and inclusive to all.</p>
