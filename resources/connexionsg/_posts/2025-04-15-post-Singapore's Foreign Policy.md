<p>In a world where countries are increasingly turning inward and acting
in their own interest, global stability may feel like a thing of the past.
International norms are being tested, multilateral cooperation is under
strain, and trust between nations is harder to sustain.</p>
<p>We may find ourselves caught in the crosswinds â€” geopolitically and economically
â€” as others seek to divide or pressure us. But we are not without strength.</p>
<p>Singaporeâ€™s relevance lies not in size, but in resilience, trust, and
staying connected. Even as the global system becomes more transactional
and fragmented, Singapore can â€” and must â€” continue to be a trusted partner
and responsible global citizen. In this new, uncertain world, our unity
matters more than ever.</p>
<p>We may face many challenges, but together, we will build a stronger future.
