Itâ€™s flavourful and oh-so-delicious! One of the best things about living in Singapore is that food from various cultures and cuisines are always available and accessible, all day, everyday!

Thosai is a South Indian dish that is popular among Singaporeans from all walks of life. Made from a blend of fermented rice and lentil batter, thosai boasts a delightful crispy texture with a slightly tangy flavor. The key lies in its artful preparation by the cook, where the batter--coated with oil--is poured, spread, cooked, and then expertly folded on a hot griddle.

But good thosai does not just solely come from the preparation, but also in the accompanying ingredients. Choose from a variety of chutneys ranging from creamy coconut to zesty tomato flavours; sambar (lentil-based vegetable stew) -- which is packed with aromatic spices and tenderly cooked vegetables; or simply curry to treat yourself to a culinary experience filled with a harmonious combination of textures and tastes!

So, whether you choose to start your day with a hearty breakfast or savour it as a delightful brunch, thosai is a much-loved dish enjoyed across the communities of our multicultural city!
