Did you know that if you drank the recommended amount of six to eight glasses of water a day from the MBS infinity pool, you would take more than twenty lifetimes to finish the entire pool?  
  
That’s how large the MBS infinity pool is! Not only that, it is the world’s largest elevated swimming pool at 150 metres long. The Sands SkyPark, where the Infinity Pool is located, is also a remarkable feat of engineering in itself - over 7,000 tonnes of steel had to be pre-assembled at ground level in 14 individual pieces, and hoisted to the top over several days.  
  
All these parts came together to create an iconic landmark in our city’s skyline, and a famous attraction that caters to millions of tourists yearly. The MBS is also the location of several events, performances, and productions - the Sands Theatre has hosted famous broadway shows such as The Lion King, Wicked and Mamma Mia, adding to the glamour and vibrancy of our city ✨✨
