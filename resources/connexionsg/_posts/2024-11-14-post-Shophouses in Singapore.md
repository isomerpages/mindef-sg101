<p>Think all shophouses are same same but different? Take a closer look the
next time you see one!
<br>
<br>First designed in the early 1800s under Sir Stamford Raffles’ vision,
the facades of Singapore’s shophouses evolved over the years as an expression
of Singapore’s diverse society. Today, shophouses in Singapore fall broadly
into six unique styles! From Chinese porcelain-chip friezes, to decorative
Peranakan tiles, to Malay roof eaves and timbre fretwork, these cultural
elements that decorate our shophouses are a strong testament to the multiracial,
multi-cultural and multi-religious society that Singapore continues to
preserve, protect and celebrate.
<br>
<br>Next time you pass by these intricate facades, share this piece of history
with a friend! Let’s celebrate the unity in our diversity!</p>
