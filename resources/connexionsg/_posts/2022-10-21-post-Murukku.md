Murukku is a deep-fried snack that has its origins from the Indian subcontinent. Savoury and crunchy, the murukku is not only a favourite of the Indians, but also favoured by the Malays and Chinese alike.

It is typically made from a semi-solid dough mixture comprising rice flour or ural dhal (black lentil) flour, salt, and spices. The murukku mixture is kneaded into a dough, which is shaped into spiral or coil shapes either by hand or extruded using a mould. The spirals are then deep fried in vegetable oil.

The name ‘murukku’ is derived from the Tamil word for ‘twisted’, which refers to its shape. However, murukku does not only come in twisted spirals. It can be in the form of puffed pillows, sticks or ribbons – the last variety is sometimes known as ribbon pakoda.

With Deepavali round the corner, goodies like murukku are a must-have!
