Have you ever done any of the following, even unintentionally?
- Talked to people in your group using a language that some do not understand, causing them to feel excluded?
- Mocked some cultures, language and traditions without considering how hurtful that could be?
- Discriminate: against someone based on racial stereotypes?
- Generalised someone’s behaviour as representative of their entire race or community?
- Used derogatory words when frustrated or angry at someone of a different race?

If you have, take a pause here to think about "casual racism" and what we can all do to make Singapore a kinder and more inclusive country for everyone here.

"Casual racism" is something that happens everyday in Singapore. It is the use of negative stereotypes or prejudices based on ethnicity against people. And while it may be unintentional and expressed through “harmless” avenues such as jokes and off-hand comments, it leaves an unpleasant taste in all involved, especially for the victims.

Singaporeans today, having lived harmoniously for decades, may forget that racial harmony here was built with much effort over the years — through the practice of mutual respect and sensitivity, after the painful experiences of racial riots in our nation’s early years.

Our enjoyment of diverse foods, music, design, art, and culture here is made possible by the peaceful interactions of diverse people, bringing a wealth of goods to the table. Today, on Racial Harmony Day (RHD), we can go the extra mile to strengthen our multiracial nation by stamping out racism, starting with our own actions. Happy RHD everyone!
