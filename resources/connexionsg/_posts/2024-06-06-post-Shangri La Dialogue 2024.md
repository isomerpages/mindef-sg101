<p>üì∑: PIONEER, 2 Jun 2024. A Call for Peace at Shangri-La Dialogue.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Have you seen the MINDEF TikTok video that went viral over the weekend?
It was part of a series covering the Shangri-La Dialogue (SLD) from 31
May to 2 Jun. Captioned ‚ÄúMen in Defence‚Äù, the video featured delegates
in ‚Äúuniform‚Äù, ‚Äúfive (foot) nine (inches tall)‚Äù and with ‚Äúnice eyes‚Äù. Viewers
were gobsmacked by the light-hearted video.
<br>
<br>What really is the SLD? Held by International Institute of Strategic Studies,
the first SLD was launched in 2002. Since its inception, the SLD has grown
from strength to strength and become the premier defence and security conference
in Asia Pacific. In its 21st edition, the SLD saw the attendance of 49
Ministerial-level representatives, and more than 40 senior defence officials
from 45 countries. The range of distinguished speakers include the US and
Chinese defence ministers, and most notably this year, Ukrainian President
Volodymyr Zelenskyy made a surprise appearance at the event.
<br>
<br>With two conflicts happening now in Europe and the Middle East and potential
flashpoints in the South China Sea, these hot-button issues dominated discussions
at the SLD this year.
<br>
<br>At the event, Minister for Defence Dr Ng Eng Hen said that there was strengthened
resolve amongst the countries present that a conflict should not occur
in Asia. One reason being that neither Asia nor the world could withstand
a third geopolitical shock as it would destablise global security. The
second being the lessons that countries had learnt on the cost and consequences
of aggression.
<br>
<br>Mr Zelenskyy called for international support for Ukraine and reiterated
the importance of diplomacy which prevented international disputes from
turning into conflicts. He acknowledged the key role that diplomacy played
in helping Ukraine withstand Russia‚Äôs attacks. ‚ÄúDiplomacy does work when
it truly aims to protect lives. Together with partners, we are defending
lives and rules-based world order‚Äù, he said.
<br>
<br>In a period of great geopolitical uncertainties, the SLD continues to
provide a valuable, open and neutral platform for world leaders and defence
ministers to have frank and robust discussions on the world‚Äôs most pressing
security concerns.
