On 1 January 1824, SingaporesFirst newspaper, the Singapore Chronicles, was published. Printed on a single piece of rough paper and folded once, the four pages held vital information about the movement of cargo, people and mail for the growing maritime port. While its main purpose was for tracking shipping, imports and exports, it also had news about events in Singapore and other countries.

The Singapore Chronicle ceased operations on September 30, 1837 after a rival publication — The Singapore Free Press and Mercantile Advertiser — emerged. The Singapore Free Press was then bought over by The Straits Times, which began operations in 1845. It soon began to publish in different languages for the multiracial population.

Since then, The Straits Times has become Singapore’s newspaper of record, chronicling our journey from being a part of the Straits Settlements, through the Japanese Occupation, merger with Malaysia, separation and independence, and to being a global city today. 

With its history intrinsically tied to our nation, Singapore’s oldest newspaper reports the news with Singaporean eyes, taking a pro-Singapore stance, especially with sensitive and emotional issues. And it strives to continually do so, as the media landscape evolves and expectations shift.
