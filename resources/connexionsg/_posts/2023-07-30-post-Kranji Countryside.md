Located in the northwestern part of Singapore, the Kranji precinct is where you can experience the great outdoors on a #SundayFunday. With farms, lush nature reserves and wildlife, you can expect to see a different and more peaceful side of Singapore in this sprawling rural area.

Kranji Countryside isn’t just limited to Kranji. More accurately, it covers Lim Chu Kang which is where the farms are located, and the Western Water Catchment Area, which is what they call the area encompassing reservoirs found on the west coast of Singapore.

Looking to take a break and maybe catch a beautiful glimpse of the Johor Bahru Straits and skyline? Then head to the serene dwelling of Kranji Reservoir Park.
Then head down to Kranji Marshes to explore its natural beauty. With various natural habitats such as woodlands, marshes, and grass habitats, you can expect to see a wide array of animal species such as birds (exotic and migratory), monitor lizards, dragonflies, butterflies, and more.

History buffs can drop by the Kranji Beach Battle Site and learn about the darkest Singapore war history and battle. The battle site was the defence site of Northwestern Singapore during World War II against the Japanese invaders.

Animal lovers can choose to feed the cutest little goats at Hay Dairies, meet the frogs at Jurong Frog Farm, or get your hands dirty at Kok Fah Technology Farm.

With so much to offer, Kranji is where you can explore the countryside and get to know nature beyond the concrete jungle.

Do note that the attractions are quite far apart from one another. Hiring a private van charter or booking a tour package would bring convenience as you could cover many places in one day easily - a great option for those of us who don’t drive.
