He’s a familiar sight to recruits, greeting thousands of soldiers and their families at Pulau Tekong.

This National Service (NS) Landmark statue was launched by the previous Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of Defence, Dr Tony Tan, near the entrance of the SAF Basic Military Training Centre (BMTC) Complex during the official opening of the new SAF BMTC at Pulau Tekong on 17 August 1999.

This 1.7-metre-tall life-sized infantry soldier, in the “On Guard” stance, stands with the SAF flag, signifying his support through defence. It represents the readiness, strength, and determination of the SAF which reflect the vital bond that exists between our citizen-soldiers and the nation.

Shielded by the flag at the back of the statue are four young children, representing the future of our diverse society. Inspired by the soldier, they will grow and eventually take on the responsibility of defending the nation.

The granite base on which the statue stands symbolises the firm foundation upon which our nation's sovereignty and prosperity rest, guaranteed by the indomitable will of the soldier.
