<p>ðŸ“·: Clementi Town Centre in the 1970s (HDB)</p>

<p></p>
<p>Situated in the southwestern part of mainland Singapore, â€˜Clementiâ€™ brings
to mind an area filled with polytechnic and university students, but <strong><a href="https://www.facebook.com/hashtag/didyouknow?__eep__=6&amp;__cft__[0]=AZUAZhQ3hid5ynq8Yk7H7vDWf66f9P01yVAVpb3SXIlVzQmVCGPxXfBC6qCyf7-pvHYxF6-TuzSxHX0DDJc3Fs0DBPYISl89-LuhD9pagiOj2qUVRdqgXq-wvX8H0lMv4UV8_Si7Zy_07DnNtjl91-bye4_qbTLNI0l7ii8wmUELW7Lcb9H_aSVn_4bdREhx-70&amp;__tn__=*NK*F" class="x1i10hfl xjbqb8w x1ejq31n xd10rxx x1sy0etr x17r0tee x972fbf xcfux6l x1qhh985 xm0m39n x9f619 x1ypdohk xt0psk2 xe8uvvx xdj266r x11i5rnm xat24cr x1mh8g0r xexx8yu x4uap5 x18d9i69 xkhd6sd x16tdsg8 x1hl2dhg xggy1nq x1a2a7pz x1sur9pj xkrqix3 xzsf02u x1s688f" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">#DidYouKnow</a></strong> that
it was once known as 'Reformatory Road' as there was a boys' home situated
along the road? It has been suggested that Clementi Road was named after
Sir Cecil Clementi, governor of the Straits Settlements from 1929 to 1934,
who was known for establishing the Societies Ordinance in 1889 to suppress
Chinese secret societies, and for starting the Queen's Scholarships. However,
the road is generally believed to be named after his uncle, Cecil Clementi
Smith, governor of the Straits Settlements from 1887 to 1893.
<br>
<br>Part of Clementi used to be swamp land; while the other part was made
up of kampongs and villages with squatter-type homes, backyard trades,
cottage industries, and farms. As the eighth new town to be developed by
the Housing and Development Board (HDB), Clementi was built to be self-sufficient
and development took place primarily between 1975 and 1979. While private
residential estates such as the Clementi Housing Estate were retained,
the HDB resettled more than 800 villagers to make way for the new town.
In addition, swamps where the town now borders West Coast Park were reclaimed
using earth taken from the townâ€™s northern hills.
<br>
<br>Serving the entire town population, the Clementi Town Centre offers a
wide range of amenities including a polyclinic, a market-cum-food centre,
retail shops and a cinema. In 2011, Clementi Mall â€“ the first development
built by HDB with public housing, commercial facilities, and a bus interchange
together in one complex â€“ was opened. Clementi is also known for the many
tertiary educational institutions located there, including Ngee Ann Polytechnic,
Singapore University of Social Sciences, and the National University of
Singapore.
<br>
<br>Just a few years ago, a gorgeous shot of the charming and rustic-looking
Clementi Forest captured in the misty morning managed to seize Singaporeans'
attention. Occupying about 85 hectares in area, the Clementi Forest offers
a unique hike with abandoned railway tracks, secret tunnels and crossings
over muddy streams. Many avid hikers travel to the west in search of this
tranquil escape from the hustle and bustle of urban life.
<br>
<br>Balancing development and conservation in land-limited Singapore is a
nuanced task. However, much like Clementi's transformation from Reformatory
Road, we can collectively progress by having faith that possible environmental
impacts will be carefully managed, and natural elements will be integrated
within developments where possible, even as Singapore continues its commitment
to future planning and meeting the evolving needs of her citizens.
