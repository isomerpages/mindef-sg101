If you‚Äôre feeling for fish üêü this weekend, then you might want to have some good old fish head curry!  
  
Fish head curry was first sold in Singapore in 1949 by M. J. Gomez, an Indian immigrant who understood the Chinese‚Äôs love for fish head. Since then, many other chefs have experimented with variations of the dish. Today, fish head curry is a popular dish served in Indian and Chinese restaurants, and one of Singapore‚Äôs well-loved cuisines!  
  
Succulent fish meat is tucked behind every nook of the fish head, which is simmered in spicy, aromatic curry borth. Vegetables like okra, tomato, and brinjal in the dish, which absorb the curry, ensure that every bite you take will burst with intense flavour in your mouth. Have it with steamed white rice for a 10/10 culinary experience this weekend!
