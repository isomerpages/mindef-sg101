#TriviaTuesday: Sentosa has a population of more than 60 peacocks. The first pair of peacocks were introduced in 1980, and today Sentosa is believed to have the largest number of peacocks in a single location in Singapore. The population there is a mix of Indian blue peafowls and Javan green peafowls.

The peacocks roam freely around the island and congregate regularly at the well-manicured gardens of the hotel compounds in Sentosa. But visitors need to avoid coming too close because the peacocks have been known to attack reflective surfaces — especially shiny cars — during mating season. They mistake their own reflections for competitors!

Sentosa has signs around the island educating people on peacock etiquette, and mirrors have also been strategically placed around most carparks in Sentosa to divert the peacocks away from vehicles.
