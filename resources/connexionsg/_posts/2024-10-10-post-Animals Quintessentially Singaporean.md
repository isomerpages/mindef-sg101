<p>“Lionel” the lizard, nicknamed by Formula 1 (F1) driver Alonso, is Singapore’s
most famous party crasher. For the third time since 2016, a Monitor Lizard
has yet again made headlines at this year’s Singapore Grand Prix as it
sped across the track. As F1 puts it, “It wouldn’t be Singapore without
a lizard on track.” Way to represent Singapore in the race!</p>
<p>Just like how F1 has grown to run a race in Singapore expecting a guest
appearance from our local monitor lizards, we too have learnt to live in
harmony with wildlife in Singapore. Remember back in November 2021, the
TraceTogether app made a splash with an adorable smiling Otter swimming
leisurely across our phones? The otter brought much-needed cheer during
a pandemic.</p>
<p>What about the loud “uwu” morning calls you hear at the break of dawn?
Chances are, it’s the Asian Koel. Some may not know the name of the bird
but many instantly recognise its distinctive call. For some, the calls
not only signals the start of the day but it also reminds them of Singapore
and home.</p>
<p>These are only but some of the wild animals we see in our neighbourhoods,
parks and nature reserves, and have become a quintessential part of our
daily lives and synonymous with our urban landscape. Although, majority
of fauna that remain on the island exist in nature reserves, human-animal
interactions have increased due to shifting environments. It is therefore
important that we appreciate our biodiversity and learn how to coexist
with animals. As we continue to make space for urban development, each
of us have a responsibility to be careful stewards of our living environment
- for our home, our island’s wildlife, and our future generations.</p>
