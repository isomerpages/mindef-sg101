Got the Monday blues? Don’t worry we all do!

It’s not easy to feel upbeat after having a fun-filled or restful weekend, but that doesn’t mean that all Mondays should be miserable. Here’s a gentle reminder of the simple things you can do for good Monday moods! 😊

(1) Go to bed earlier on Sunday night. 💤 Getting a full night of sleep can help you feel refreshed when your alarm goes off on Monday morning.

(2) Make a list of things that you are looking forward to that week. 🗒️

(3) Start your day off with a good breakfast helps you to stay energised as you ease back into your weekly grind 🍴.

(4) Don’t overdo it with your schedule. 😌 Whenever possible, try to avoid scheduling meetings or big tasks on Monday, so that you would not feel overwhelmed when flooded with meetings after coming back from a relaxing weekend.

(5) Plan something fun. 👭 Knowing that you’ll do a fun activity, such as meeting up with a friend after work, can give you a brighter start to your week.

Having something to look forward to can go a long way in combating the Monday blues. What puts you in a good mood on Mondays?
