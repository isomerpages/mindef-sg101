A delicious, sweet-and-tangy peanut-based tofu dish, Tahu Goreng is often eaten during breakfast or as a light snack. â€˜Gorengâ€™ simply means â€˜friedâ€™, and â€˜Tahuâ€™ refers to â€˜tofuâ€™. It is entirely vegetarian but still packed with protein, making it a great option to enjoy as a snack or appetiser.

When preparing the dish, cakes of firm tofu are deep fried until golden brown. A popular way to serve fried tofu is to cut them diagonally in half, and garnished with bean sprouts, cucumber, and scallion.

A thick peanut gravy is prepared with shallots, garlic, chilli peppers, shrimp paste (called Belacan), soy sauce and tamarind juice, and roasted ground peanuts. The peanut gravy is then poured over the other ingredients.

The contrast between the crispy exterior of the Tahu and its soft insides is essential to the allure of the dish. A good plate of Tahu Goreng should also have a taste contrast of sweet and spicy, with a fresh crunch from the vegetables and peanuts.

Hmm, so delicious! ðŸ˜‹
