Located at the heart of Jewel Changi Airport, the Rain Vortex is a stunning waterfall that cascades through the centre of the building from a height of 40 metres. That is about seven storeys high, making it the world‚Äôs tallest indoor waterfall!

Designed by the renowned architect Moshe Safdie, who also designed the iconic Marina Bay Sands, the Jewel is Changi Airport‚Äôs latest nature-themed lifestyle destination modelled after a ‚Äúmythical garden‚Äù. The Rain Vortex is surrounded by a lush greenery of over 2,000 trees and 100,000 shrubs from all over the world.

It is one of Asia's most extensive indoor gardens. Did you know? The oldest residents are a pair of olive trees from Spain that are at least a hundred years old! The unique garden spaces in Jewel offers a refreshing and relaxing environment for visitors to enjoy.

Jewel is part of the continuous evolution of our Changi Airport. It started with the need to expand the capacity of Changi Airport‚Äôs Terminal 1 and its open-air carpark. This led to a strategic vision with the conception of Jewel as a gem of a destination to augment Changi Airport‚Äôs position as a leading air hub globally, and boost its appeal as a stopover destination for travellers. In the world of lifestyle design, it is an innovative integration of garden and marketplace housed under a striking glass and steel dome.

Changi Airport has come a long way since our humble beginnings in 1981, from a small aviation hub to the world-class airport complex gaining international recognition over the years. This is Jewel loved by both Singaporeans and the world üíé
