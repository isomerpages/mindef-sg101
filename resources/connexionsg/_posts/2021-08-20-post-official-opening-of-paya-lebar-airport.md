<p>#onthisday (20 Aug) in 1955, Paya Lebar Airport officially opened after
three years of development, replacing Kallang International Airport as
our gateway to the world.</p>
<p>When it was first opened, some called Paya Lebar Airport the finest in
Asia: it had the latest approach and runway lighting, modern radio navigational
aids, and surveillance radar. The arrival hall was built in the Modern
style, with high ceilings, black and gold marble pillars, and an iconic
mushroom-shaped information counter. A mural of Raffles Place embellished
the arrival hall, while another depicting life in Singapore enlivened the
rooftop viewing gallery. The airport was even featured in foreign films,
including Peter Bogdanovich's Saint Jack (1979) and Georg Marischka’s Peter
Voss, Hero of the Day (1959).</p>
<p>For 26 years, Paya Lebar Airport served as Singapore’s commercial airport.
In this time, air travel continued to expand rapidly, and Paya Lebar Airport
responded with expansions that included a runway extension from 8,000 to
9,000-ft in 1962 (one of the longest in Asia at the time), and passenger
terminals in 1964 and 1977.</p>
<p>However, all that was not enough. In 1960, the airport was processing
300,000 passengers a year. But by 1970, that number had shot up to 1.7
million a year. As Lim Chin Beng, then-Director of Administration of the
Malaysia-Singapore Airlines said, ‘it was very clear we needed a new airport.
Paya Lebar had runway capacity, but that wasn’t the problem. The huge traffic
was.’</p>
<p>And so plans began for a new commercial airport in Changi, which opened
in 1981. Paya Lebar Airport still stands today, as part of the RSAF’s Paya
Lebar Air Base. But with the relocation of Paya Lebar Air Base from 2030s
onwards, new plans are being made to transform the space into “a community
of the future”. What ideas will take flight there? What will arrive and
what will go? How should Singaporeans today pass on Paya Lebar’s heritage
to Singaporeans tomorrow?</p>
