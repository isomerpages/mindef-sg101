#DidYouKnow that the Treetop Walk is the first of its kind in Singapore, and also the region!

Hope you don’t have a fear of heights!

Officially launched in 2004, the Treetop Walk is a free-standing suspension bridge situated in MacRitchie Reservoir. The bridge, 250 metres in length and reaching 25 metres in height, connects the two highest points of the reservoir -- Bukit Pierce and Bukit Kalang.

Open to the public for recreation, the Treetop Walk is a popular destination among locals. On the bridge, you will be able to enjoy a panoramic view of the surrounding scenery, as well as the lush variety of plants and animals that live in the forest canopy, all while taking in the pleasant smells and sounds of the forest -- the perfect way to start a lovely weekend!

Lesser known to us is that the Treetop Walk is well-suited for more than just recreational purposes. It is also utilised for forest canopy research, the research of plants and animals living in the forest canopy. In the past, researchers would be hard-pressed to gain any meaningful elevation to conduct forest canopy research; the bridge, however, with its height, allows researchers to do so, and further bolsters our understanding of our island’s precious forest ecosystem!
