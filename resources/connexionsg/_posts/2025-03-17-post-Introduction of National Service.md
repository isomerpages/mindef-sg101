<p>In 1967, shortly two years after Singaporeâ€™s independence, a bold and
necessary step to safeguard our future â€“ National Service (NS) was introduced.
Through decades, NS grew beyond deterrence and diplomacy; it became a national
institution and a way of life for many Singaporean sons.</p>
<p>Almost every Singaporean family has experienced NS in some form â€” whether
as a parent sending their son off for Basic Military Training, friends
supporting each other through tough training days, or a sister proudly
showing up for her brother at his passing out parade. NS has become a shared
experience that brings together Singaporeans and PRs from all races, languages,
religions, and backgrounds to train, live, and serve the nation.</p>
<p>Many have quipped how NS is a rite of passage â€” where boys grow into men,
and lifelong friendships are forged through moments of hardship and resilience.
These common, life-shaping experiences have helped build the cohesion and
national identity we share and cherish today.</p>
<p>None of this would be possible without the support of the whole nation
â€” families, employers, and the wider community who stand behind our servicemen.

<p>As Singapore turns 60 this year, we also mark SAF60 â€” a reminder that
the story of the SAF is deeply intertwined with the growth story of our
nation and its future.</p>
