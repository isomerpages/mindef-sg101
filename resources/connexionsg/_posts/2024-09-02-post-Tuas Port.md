the Tuas Port, which officially opened on 1 September 2022, is set to be
the world's largest fully automated terminal by the 2040s!</p>
<p>Former Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong said at its opening that Tuas Port
will be pivotal in driving Singapore’s economy and reinforcing its status
as a leading international maritime centre.</p>
<p>Tuas Port is not just about its size — it's about setting new standards
for global maritime operations. When fully completed, Tuas Port will have
the capacity to handle 65 million twenty-foot equivalent units (TEUs),
almost double the volume of 37.5mil TEUs handled in 2021.</p>
<p>Tuas Port will create a connected supply chain and logistics ecosystem
along Singapore’s western seaboard. Container port operator PSA Singapore
plans to shift all operations from Tanjong Pagar, Keppel, Brani, and Pasir
Panjang Terminals to Tuas by the 2040s. Centralising these operations will
leverage economies of scale, streamline cargo handling, and reduce costs,
enhancing Singapore’s role as a global maritime hub. Additionally, the
centralisation of all our ports will free up prime waterfront land for
redevelopment projects like the Greater Southern Waterfront.</p>
<p>This next-generation port will boast features such as automated wharf
and yard functions, and full-electric automated guided vehicles. PSA has
also built up its data analytics and digitalisation capabilities as part
of Tuas Port’s modular design, allowing for flexibility and agility to
respond to rapidly changing demands of maritime port operations as it continues
to develop into the 2040’s and beyond.</p>
<p>To learn more about the Tuas Port, visitors can head down to the Tuas
Port Discovery Centre, which offers an interactive and educational experience
about the development and future of the Tuas Port. One can explore exhibits
that showcase the port's innovative technology, sustainability initiatives,
and the role it plays in enhancing Singapore's position as a global maritime
hub.</p>
