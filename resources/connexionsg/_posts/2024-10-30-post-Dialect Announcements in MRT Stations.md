<p>#TIL Some of our MRT stations feature safety announcements in common dialects
like Hokkien and Cantonese! ðŸš‡</p>
<p>In stations such as Chinatown, Toa Payoh, and Redhill, which are near
mature residential areas or amenities that are frequently visited by elderly
commuters who might be more familiar with dialects, these special announcements
are a thoughtful way to connect with our seniors. ðŸ§“ðŸ‘µ</p>
<p>This initiative highlights how small adjustments can make a big difference.
The introduction of dialect safety messages not only enhances safety of
our commuters, it also creates a more inclusive experience for everyone
by reinforcing respect and care for our minority dialect-speaking population
and a sense of community.</p>
<p>Next time youâ€™re at one of these stations, listen out for the announcements
â€“ theyâ€™re a meaningful reminder of how small gestures of care and inclusivity
can go a long way to bring everyone together in our diverse, vibrant community.</p>
