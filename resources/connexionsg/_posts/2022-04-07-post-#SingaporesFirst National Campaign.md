Not so long ago, in trying to shape our nation, campaigns were a big thing in Singapore. One study counted sixty-six national campaigns in just 24 years (1958 to 1982)!

#SingaporesFirst national campaign came before our independence – in August 1958.

The Anti-Spitting Campaign reminded people that spitting, then commonplace, was socially irresponsible and might contribute to the spread of pneumonia. It got the full works: a large poster was draped across the front of the City Council (City Hall) building. Bridges, telegraph poles, and trees were emblazoned with posters and signs. About 100 workers in the Singapore City Council’s health and water departments went door-to-door to distribute pamphlets and speak about the dangers of spitting in public.

Campaigns were a key part of our nation-building: they shaped our collective values, and reminded us to think of others. The need for campaigns tapered off as Singaporeans matured as a people. We have come to understand that our small, individual actions – whether spitting into a handkerchief in 1958, or coughing and sneezing with our masks on in 2022 – add up to a nation made stronger, for all. 😷🤧
