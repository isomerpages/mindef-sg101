<p>Every year, millions around the world celebrate Deepavali â€“ 'The Festival
of Lightsâ€™, to mark the triumph of good over evil and light over darkness.
ðŸª” âœ¨</p>
<p>With Deepavali just around the corner, we thought to share some things
you may not know:</p>
<p>1) Most people tend to wrongly associate Deepavali with the Tamil New
Year.</p>
<p>However, Tamil New Year, also known as Puthandu, usually falls in mid-April,
whereas Deepavali falls on the 14th day of the dark fortnight, or the waning
moon, in the month of Aippasi in the Tamil calendar. This is usually mid-October
to mid-November in the Gregorian calendar.</p>

<p>2) Deepavali celebrations can last for four to five days.</p>
<p>More commonly referred to by South Indians as Deepavali, the celebrations
can last for four days, with the first day marking Lord Krishnaâ€™s triumphant
slaying of the demon Narakasura.</p>
<p>North Indians refer to this festival as Diwali, and start their five-day
celebrations a day later with the lighting of lamps to welcome the return
of exiled king Lord Rama of Ayodhya.</p>

<p>3) Though Deepavali is mainly a Hindu festival, it is also celebrated
by Indians of other religions such as the Sikhs and the Jains.</p>
<p>For Sikhs, it marks the day that Guru Hargobind Ji, the Sixth Sikh Guru,
was freed from imprisonment. In Jainism, it marks the spiritual awakening
of Lord Mahavir</p>
