Putu Piring is a round, steamed rice cake filled with gula melaka (or melted palm sugar).

Made of ground rice flour, the Putu Piring cakes are shaped by aluminium conical moulds into circular mounds. A spoonful of gula melaka is then placed in the centre and then covered with a second layer of rice flour. The mould is turned upside down and placed on a muslin cloth lining a small plate for steaming. Each mould is then covered with a conical lid and steamed for a few minutes.

Once cooked, the Putu Piring is then placed on a banana leaf and served with freshly grated coconut.

â€˜Putuâ€™ comes from the Tamil language that refers to food made from flour or rice, while â€˜Piringâ€™ stands for â€˜plateâ€™ in Malay, which references the small metallic plates that are used to create the dish.

Putu Piring, Putu Mayam, and Tutu Kueh share similarities as they evolved in Singapore. One common ingredient in these delicious snacks is the rice flour and steaming method of cooking. Putu Piring is often mistakenly referred to as Tutu Kueh which has peanut or coconut filling and is smaller in size than the Putu Piring, which has gula melaka as filling and is eaten with grated coconut.
Mmmm, tasty! ðŸ˜‹
