<p>In 2023, a minute-long siren was played during the National Day Parade.
That was the sound of the ‚ÄúImportant Message‚Äù signal.</p>
<p>This same siren will be aired this evening at 6.20pm.</p>
<p>In fact, we have an island-wide network of more than 2,000 sirens installed
at strategic points, including rooftops and certain grounds. The Public
Warning System (PWS) was installed all over Singapore by the Singapore
Civil Defence Force, to warn the public of imminent threats that could
endanger lives and property.</p>

<p>üé•: The Making of the SCDF Public Warning System (<a href="https://www.youtube.com/@SingaporeCivilDefenceForce" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">SCDF Youtube</a>)</p>
<hr>
<p>Annually, the SCDF sounds the "Important Message" signal through the island-wide
network of PWS sirens on 15 February and 15 September at 6.20 pm. The signal
will also sound for 20 seconds on all smartphones that have the SGSecure
mobile app.</p>
<p>15 Feb 6.20pm was to commemorate our Total Defence Day and the date Singapore
fell to the invasion of Japan during WWII, while the purpose of sounding
the siren on 15 Sep is to familiarise members of the public by conducting
the ‚Äòexercise‚Äô twice a year.</p>
<p>Once you hear the ‚ÄúImportant Message‚Äù signal, you should tune in to any
local radio station or free-to-air MediaCorp TV channel for a brief message
on the PWS. Apart from the "Important Message " Signal, there are also
the "Alarm " Signal (sounded when when an air raid or shelling is imminent)
and "All Clear " Signal (sounded when the threat is over).</p>
<p>The significance of acquainting ourselves with the PWS signals extends
far beyond our immediate circumstances, and it‚Äôd be dangerously myopic
to assume that there is ‚Äúno need to panic‚Äù since we live in a ‚Äúconflict-free‚Äù
zone. The world is a complex and ever-evolving stage, where peace can suddenly
be disrupted. In the words of a Ukrainian, Antonina Kolpovska who fled
her homeland and sought refuge in Denmark three weeks after Russia‚Äôs invasion
of Ukraine, ‚ÄúI will never forget the first air-raid siren‚Äù.</p>
<p>While we might not be able to control our external circumstances, we can
equip and give ourselves the power to respond adequately and smartly, should
emergencies arise.</p>
