<p>Work has officially begun on Changi Airport Terminal 5 (T5), marking a
significant milestone in our nation's aviation journey. 🚧✈️
<br>
<br>The development of T5 is a bold move for Singapore and its aviation sector,
amid sharpening competition from other airports and an uncertain global
economy. #Didyouknow the new T5 would effectively double the size of Changi
Airport, and was designed to withstand extreme weather and the effects
of climate change such as rising sea levels?
<br>
<br>Zooming out, T5 will be part of the 1,080ha Changi East development, which
also includes:
<br>&nbsp;(1) Changi East Industrial Zone – boosting cargo and logistics capabilities
<br>&nbsp;(2) Changi East Urban District – a future mixed-use area for connection,
work and play</p>
<p>Forward looking and future ready, T5 is poised to not only be a preferred
stopover but a destination in its own right! ✈️🚆🚌</p>
