If you’re looking to clock your mileage this #SundayFunday, why not visit the MacRitchie Nature Reserve?

Anchored by Singapore’s largest reservoir, the MacRitchie Nature Reserve is one of Singapore’s most popular hiking spots. The park boasts six different nature trails that range from three kilometres to 11 kilometres in length, and is home to countless species of native plants and animals, including the iconic long-tailed macaque monkeys.

Take a trek atop the Treetop Walk aerial suspension bridge for a scenic view 25 metres above the ground, or traverse one of the many boardwalks that allow visitors to explore the lush greenery without damaging the environment. If heights and hiking aren’t for you, you can always go canoeing or kayaking in MacRitchie Reservoir itself!

MacRitchie Reservoir Park also houses historical sites such as the grave of local war hero Colonel Lim Bo Seng and the ruins of Syonan Jinja, a World War Two-era Japanese Shinto shrine.

With many attractions, activities, and breathtaking views to offer, MacRitchie Nature Reserve is an excellent destination for anyone who loves fun and the outdoors!
