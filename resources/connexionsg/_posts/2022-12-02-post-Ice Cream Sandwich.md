Who has not seen ice-cream uncles peddling cold, delicious, heat-busting ice cream outside schools or places with high foot traffic? So many flavours - from more ‚Äòtypical‚Äô flavours such as chocolate, mint, and vanilla, to flavours with a local tinge such as sweet corn and durian.

A unique feature of the ice cream sandwich is in how it is prepared and served. Rather than stacking round scoops of ice cream on a cone or in a cup, vendors slice individual portions from a large block of your flavour of choice, and serve he ice cream in--again, depending on your preference--wrapped in either a slice of bread or wafer biscuits, or simply in a cup. The ice cream sandwich is so iconic to Singapore that tourists flock to these vendors for the complete Singapore experience!

Enjoy one of these sweet treats on a hot, humid day and feel the bliss of the cold, creamy ice cream melt down your throat! üòã Let us know in the comments if you prefer your ice cream sandwich wrapped in a bread, wafer biscuit, or served in a cup! üç¶üç¶üç¶
