<p>Beneath a stretch of Bidadari Park lies #SingaporesFirst underground service
reservoir (USR), which will supply drinking water to about 8,800 households
in the Bidadari estate this year. ðŸ’¦</p>

<p>Built to optimise land use and address growing water needs, the Bidadari
USR also serves as a stormwater collection system, capturing runoff from
the surrounding area and contributing to Singapore's water resilience.
The new water pipelines are almost entirely underground, with only the
700 sqm pumping station of the USR located above ground. The reservoir
holds enough treated water to fill three Olympic-size pools, boosting water
supply during peak periods to ensure good pressure and acting as a backup
during emergencies.</p>

<p>The Bidadari USR reflects Singaporeâ€™s commitment to sustainable water
management. Built underground to maximise space, it seamlessly integrates
with the beautiful green spaces of Bidadari Park, blending modern infrastructure
with the natural environment while ensuring a reliable water supply.</p>
<p>The construction of reservoirs like this one is part of Singapore's long-term
water security efforts, driven by forward-thinking infrastructure planning,
innovation, and technology. As a city constantly striving to balance development
with sustainability, this is just one example of working towards a greener,
more resilient future. ðŸš°</p>
<p>ðŸ‘‰ Did you know that Singapore is home to over 10 other service reservoirs?
How do you think cities can better integrate essential infrastructure with
nature? ðŸŒ¿</p>
