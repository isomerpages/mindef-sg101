<p>Built to optimise land use and address growing water needs, the Bidadari
USR holds enough potable water to fill three Olympic-size pools, boosting
water supply during peak periods to ensure good pressure and acting as
a backup during emergencies. It reflects Singaporeâ€™s commitment to sustainable
water management.</p>

<p>The Bidadari USR is located almost entirely underground, saving up to
1,500 sq m of land above ground. It seamlessly integrates with the beautiful
green spaces of Bidadari Park, blending modern infrastructure with the
natural environment while ensuring a reliable water supply.</p>
<p>The construction of service reservoirs like this is part of Singapore's
long-term water security efforts, driven by forward-thinking infrastructure
planning, innovation, and technology. As a city constantly striving to
balance development with sustainability, this is just one example of working
towards a greener, more resilient future. ðŸš°</p>
<p>ðŸ‘‰ Did you know that Singapore is home to over 10 other service reservoirs?
How do you think cities can better integrate essential infrastructure with
nature? ðŸŒ¿</p>
