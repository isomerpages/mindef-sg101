<p>Seen someone in need of assistance during one of your daily commutes on
public transport?
<br>
<br>The Heart Zone initiative is a collaboration between the Public Transport
Council (PTC), the Land Transport Authority (LTA), and public transport
operators and various partners from the community. The initiative started
in 2017 to foster a caring commuter culture in Singapore as part of the
Caring SG Commuters movement. By integrating art work, signages, and posters
into existing public transport infrastructure, it encourages commuters
to help other fellow commuters who may need assistance during their public
transport journey.
<br>
<br>The Heart Zone initiative was first implemented in Outram Park MRT Station
in Aug 2017, and has since extended to 11 locations across 10 public transport
nodes and one hospital, including busy locations such as Yishun, Jurong
East, and Novena MRT stations. Such public transport nodes are key locales
for access to major hospitals, and these Heart Zones would provide clear
directions to, and encourage commuters to assist individuals in need to
reach said hospitals.
<br>
<br>While seemingly innocuous to most commuters, these zones are actually
extremely valuable to certain groups of people -- especially the elderly,
people with mobility issues, and hospital visitors. Transport hubs can
get very busy during peak hours, and large and clear signages in these
zones help them to navigate the crowd and reach their destination safely.
<br>
<br>Even more importantly, it raises awareness in our able-bodied commuters
to look out for and assist those in need at these areas.
<br>
<br>The journey to a more caring, selfless, and hospitable Singapore would
not be initiated by changes to policy and infrastructure, but with everyone
displaying graciousness to one another and looking out for others beyond
oneself. This is key to making daily commutes more inclusive and pleasant
for everyone. Our genuine acts of kindness will go a long way in helping
those who need it,and foster a more supportive and inclusive Singapore
for all!</p>
