#TIL that more than fifty years ago, concerned about a serious water shortage in the world, we have already started highlighting the importance of water and advocating for the sustainable management of our water.

Singapore’s then-Acting Minister for Communications Mr Ong Teng Cheong said in a speech in 1976: “The United Nations Food and Agricultural Organisation has sounded a grim warning of a serious water shortage in the world in about 30 years’ time when the world’s population will have doubled and the demand for water tripled.”

He made three points on why we should not take Singapore’s access to fresh drinking water of high quality for granted:

1) Fresh drinking water is precious — not only is it something we cannot do without, it is also costly to produce.

2) It requires constant capital expenditure — to meet the ever increasing demand for water. More reservoirs, treatment plants, pumps, and distribution mains have to be built., and the depreciation of plants and equipment over the years will have to be dealt with. These will contribute to the cost of water.

3) We cannot afford to waste water — people have to be encouraged to have good habits in the use of waster, and avoid habits such as cleaning or washing under a running tap.

“We must always remember that water is precious and each of us must do his part in our national effort to save water.” As we observe Singapore World Water Day today (22 March), let us #MakeEveryDropCount. #GoBlue4SG
