<p>Most of us are familiar with Pasir Ris as “white sand”, but did you know
it is also speculated to be a contraction of “Pasir Iris”, where Pasir
means “sand”, and Iris means “to shred”?
<br>
<br>Test your heritage knowledge! How many of these Pasir Ris facts did you
already know?
<br>
<br>Early Days and Development: Pasir Ris started as a low-lying expanse with
kampong. Before urbanisation, Pasir Ris was largely covered by mangrove
swamps and occupied by a small Malay community engaged in fishing and agriculture.
It then evolved into a recreational haven with the introduction of beachfront
holiday bungalows in the 19th century. Originally a retreat for the elite,
a transformation occurred in 1958 when the Singapore Rural Board revamped
the beaches. Then Chief Minister Lim Yew Hock formally inaugurated the
facilities at Pasir Ris Beach in August 1958, declaring them "available
to everyone on the island." Through various efforts, Pasir Ris’s public
image shifted to a more inclusive one.
<br>
<br>Nature and Recreation: From company retreats to birthday celebrations
and class gatherings, these recreational spaces have become the heart of
Pasir Ris’ vibrant community life. Pasir Ris Park, located off Elias Road,
boasts a mangrove forest and is a favourite spot for residents. Meanwhile,
Downtown East, an entertainment hub, underwent a massive redevelopment,
featuring Singapore’s first nature-inspired resort with an integrated waterpark
experience. The cycling route network in Pasir Ris has also expanded, increasing
recreational space and sustainable transport options.
<br>
<br>Residential Evolution: From an undeveloped area, Pasir Ris transformed
into a coastal residential town. The first HDB residents moved in 1988,
and by 2015, the town had 111,000 residents. Today, Pasir Ris retains its
resort-like ambience with beach-inspired housing blocks. Under the Remaking
Our Heartland program since 2017, the town continues evolving.
