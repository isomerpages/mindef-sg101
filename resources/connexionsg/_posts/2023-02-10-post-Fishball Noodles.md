A delicious, piping hot bowl of fishball noodles is never far away â€” this popular dish can be commonly found in our hawker centres, food courts, and coffee shops in Singapore, with long, snaking queues at the most famous outlets.

Customers can choose between mee pok (wide, flat egg noodles) or mee kia (long, thin egg noodles). The noodles are cooked al-dente to give it a chewy texture, and are then usually tossed in small amounts of oil, soy sauce, chilli paste, and black vinegar, and served with fishballs, sliced fish cake, lettuce, bean sprouts, and with some vendors, fish dumplings.

The key ingredient in the dish is undoubtedly the fish balls, which are made from fresh minced fish, then mixed with salt, seasoning, and either tapioca or corn starch. The paste is then rolled into a ball shape and boiled. Freshly made fishballs would have a springy, chewy texture with a mildly fishy and savoury taste, and, combined with generous seasoning and the perfectly cooked mee pok or mee kia, results in a tasty, mouth-watering dish that would be sure to satisfy you any time of the day.

Of course, with all the seasoning used, fishball noodles generally carry a high salt content, and is best eaten in moderation! That said, wheredo you usually get your favourite fishball noodles? Tell us in the comments!
