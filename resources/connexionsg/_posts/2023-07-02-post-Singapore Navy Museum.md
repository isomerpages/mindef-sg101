#Didyouknow that Singapore’s navy comprised just two wooden ships when it was first formed as the Straits Settlement Royal Navy Volunteer Reserve (SSRNVR)?

These are the types of interesting facts that you can learn about our island nation’s naval history in the newly reopened Navy Museum! Housed in Changi Naval Base, the refurbished museum comprises three stories with an array of exhibitions to help visitors understand Singapore’s maritime nature and the history of the RSN.

Key highlights of the Navy Museum include a state-of-the-art multimedia show that showcases Singapore’s seafaring roots and the navy’s role in guarding Singapore’s water, artefacts from one of the Singapore’s first two ships -- the RSN Panglima, and miniature models of RSN ships.

Beyond the history of the RSN, the museum also displays the armaments our RSN uses, including a massive hyperbaric chamber and various missiles. There is also an impressive outdoor display which includes guns such as the Bofors 76 mm L/50 mm Gun and OTO Melara 76 mm Super Rapid Gun, used on our ships.

As a maritime nation, the RSN is crucial in defending Singapore’s trade interests. For a #SundayFunday activity, consider heading down to the newly reopened Navy Museum to learn more about the RSN’s role in securing our nation’s livelihoods!
