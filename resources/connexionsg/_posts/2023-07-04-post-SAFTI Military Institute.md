#TriviaTuesday: SAFTI MI used to be an open camp, and visitors could go to the two-storey SAFTI MI library to return National Library Board books.

SAFTI was an acronym for Singapore Armed Forces (SAF) Training Institute, but has now become a name in itself for the institute, reflecting SAFTI MI's heritage and close links with the old SAFTI.

Generations of soldiers have passed through its gates to experience some of the toughest training of their lives. But did you know, SAFTI MI was also originally designed as an "open camp" accessible to everyone, much like the United States Military and Naval Academy.

Before the 9/11 terrorist attacks, civilians did not need passes or undergo security checks to enter the camp. The only restricted areas were the camp offices and living quarters. Since then, there are armed sentries at entrances, and security checks are mandatory for all.
