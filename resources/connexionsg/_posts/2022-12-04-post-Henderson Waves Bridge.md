Healthhub.sg recommends aiming for at least 150 minutes of moderate-intensity or 75 minutes of vigorous-intensity aerobic physical activity per week - a brisk-walk would surely help reduce health risks, and relieve stress and anxiety.

If youâ€™re wondering where you can take a walk after a delicious Sunday dinner, consider heading over to the Henderson Waves Bridge through the Southern Ridges Walk for a walk to burn off some of the calories!

Standing at 36 metres above ground, the Henderson Waves Bridge was unveiled in 2008 and sports a unique design mimicking undulating waves - hence the name. From the bridge, you will be able to take in the sights, scents, and sounds of our local wildlife, along with some stunning views of the island to boot!
