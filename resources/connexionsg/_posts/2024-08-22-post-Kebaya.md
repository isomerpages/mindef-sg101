<p>What comes to mind when you think of our iconic Singapore Girl, or <em>The Little Nyonya</em> from
Mediacorp television series? Arresting images of the beautiful and intricate <em>Kebaya</em>.</p>
<p>&nbsp;A traditional form of women‚Äôs dress iconic to Southeast Asia, the <em>Kebaya</em> is
a long-sleeved open-fronted upper garment made from a variety of fabrics
such as velvet, cotton, gauze, lace or voile, and is often adorned with
intricate embroidery. It is typically identified as a blouse or tunic with
the collar extending from the back of the neck down to the hems on either
side of the front body.</p>
<p>&nbsp;The <em>kebaya</em>‚Äôs front is secured with either buttons, pins,
or <em>kerongsang</em>&nbsp;(brooch), with an accompanying lower garment
known as <em>sarong</em> (a stitched and tubular skirt) or <em>kain kain&nbsp;</em>(a
long piece of rectangular cloth wrapped and tucked around the waist)<em>,</em> which
may at times be secured with a <em>tali pinggang</em> (belt) or <em>stagen</em> (cummerbund).
The k<em>ebaya</em> is adorned with embroidered motifs known as&nbsp;<em>sulam</em>,
sewn on using a combination of stitches. Floral motifs are common due to
their feminine associations.</p>
<p>&nbsp;In different parts of Southeast Asia, the <em>kebaya</em> took on
varying forms, reflecting the diverse cultural identities of its people.
From the ornately embroidered <em>Kebaya Nyonya</em> in Malaysia and Singapore
inspired by the Chinese, Malays and the Peranakans, to the elegant and
simpler <em>Kebaya Bali</em>, each style tells a story of cultural intersections
and historical evolution. As the <em>kebaya&nbsp;offers a </em>form of&nbsp;shared
history in the region, and is an intangible cultural heritage element that
transcends ethnicity and religion, #DidYouKnow that for the very first
time, Brunei, Malaysia, Singapore and Thailand have jointly nominated the <em>kebaya</em> for
the UNESCO Representative List of&nbsp;Intangible Cultural Heritage of
Humanity in 2023? This was Singapore‚Äôs first multinational nomination,
and the first ever multinational nomination involving the four countries.
The nomination aims to celebrate and showcase how kebaya continues to be
made and worn by many communities across Southeast Asia and how its related
knowledge and skills are actively transmitted.</p>
<p>&nbsp;In Singapore,<em> </em>the <em>Kebaya</em> has ‚Äì and especially so
in recent years ‚Äì been a central aspect in the representation and display
of cultural heritage and identity for various Singapore communities. For
example, a&nbsp;<em>kebaya</em>&nbsp;may feature motifs from Malay, Chinese,
Indian, and European cultures, be they flowers, animals, mythical creatures,
or figurative elements, or traditional Javanese motifs and batik patterns
such as the&nbsp;<em>kawung</em>&nbsp;(palm fruit). The <em>Kebaya</em> has
also made its way into traditional performing art forms such as the Wayang
Peranakan, or in contemporary theatre productions such as Emily of Emerald
Hill. We can also see <em>Kebaya</em> commonly worn during festive occasions
such as Hari Raya Puasa, Chinese New Year, or at important rites of passage
such as weddings, formal events, parties, and even non-formal occasions.
‚ÄúModern <em>kebayas</em>‚Äù have also sprung up ‚Äì usually unembroidered, they
are made from materials such as printed batik, cotton, satin and chiffon.
Many young women today choose to pair the <em>kebaya</em> with Western-style
dresses, skirts and even jeans!</p>
<p>&nbsp;Indeed, the <em>Kebaya</em> is a microcosm of the melting pot of cultures
and craft traditions in Singapore and the Southeast Asia region. More than
a traditional garment, it is a symbol of cultural identity, heritage, and
timeless representation for various communities in both formal and casual
settings. Its versatility and adaptability to modern fashion trends helps
to keep alive a rich cultural heritage and contributes to its ongoing story.</p>
