<p>Did you manage to catch the 2024 Olympics live in Paris? Well, most of
us did not but <a href="https://www.facebook.com/hashtag/didyouknow?__eep__=6&amp;__cft__[0]=AZXIn8jxdwx4A9kjJvs8uBUGZO-X52juwS_BYImMH17h2DvjdyiOs5pNfA0Zh91cVkR9l4U7YTebbdA_1yru6ExJ46wagvQzTNSJR02yKZ8Dko2hD8DF7ToLfgdEsL6CZmOS0dubMkwIsfFapfGBIveZsI4CtolCilYTnU7SHa1GEsuJH_7JrhmdqIT73YEuEQo1uYTvzTCPZKGZshVIHfui&amp;__tn__=*NK-R" class="x1i10hfl xjbqb8w x1ejq31n xd10rxx x1sy0etr x17r0tee x972fbf xcfux6l x1qhh985 xm0m39n x9f619 x1ypdohk xt0psk2 xe8uvvx xdj266r x11i5rnm xat24cr x1mh8g0r xexx8yu x4uap5 x18d9i69 xkhd6sd x16tdsg8 x1hl2dhg xggy1nq x1a2a7pz x1sur9pj xkrqix3 x1fey0fg xo1l8bm" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">#didyouknow</a> that
many Singaporeans had the chance to back in 2010? That was because Singapore
hosted the inaugural Youth Olympic Games (YOG) in 2010! Mooted by the International
Olympic Committee, the YOG aims to inspire youths to embrace and express
the Olympic values of striving for excellence, demonstrating respect, as
well as to celebrate friendship.</p>
<p>The YOG is as much about culture and education as it is about sports.
Hence, the Culture and Education Programme (CEP) is a key component of
the YOG. Under the CEP, the Singapore edition held activities such as the
Singapore 2010 Friendship Camp, dialogues with Olympians, and had booths
at the Youth Olympic Village to promote interaction and engender friendships
amongst youths across different cultures. It also featured many firsts
in the history of the Olympic Movement. These included new sport formats
such as three-on-three basketball games and mixed gender events to promote
greater gender diversity, as well as introduce elements of unpredictability
and thrill for athletes and fans alike.</p>
<p>The YOG 2010 presented an opportunity for Singaporeans to experience an
Olympic event on home ground and make history together as we hosted the
first-ever YOG. The 12-day event took two years of preparation and involved
some 20,000 volunteers. It enabled Singaporean youths to build confidence
and skills as they took on various roles at the YOG, as well as showcased
Singapore’s hospitality, friendship, efficiency and dynamism to the world.</p>
<p>The YOG is no doubt one of the memorable highlights of Singapore’s sporting
history that Singaporeans can be proud of.</p>
