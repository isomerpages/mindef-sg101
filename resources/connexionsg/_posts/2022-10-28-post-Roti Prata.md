A soft and yet crisp flatbread, roti prata is often eaten together with dhal curry. Roti prata is usually prepared by Indians or Indian Muslims at neighbourhood coffee shops or restaurants and is enjoyed by different ethnic communities in Singapore.

Roti prata is best enjoyed eaten with the fingers; the roti prata is torn into bite-size pieces and dipped into curry before being popped into the mouth.

Flipping the dough is considered a most difficult step, requiring much skill. The dough has to be whirled and twirled from left to right, and from right to left until it is paper thin and has stretched multiple times from its original size and then folded into a rectangle or disc. All for that chewy yet light texture to soak up gravy. A well-made prata has a great mouth-feel: crispy on the outside and soft on the inside.

While you certainly can eat roti prata with a fork, many Singaporeans tend to eschew cutlery and just use their fingers. Hmm, do you prefer the plain prata or prata with egg? ðŸ˜‹
