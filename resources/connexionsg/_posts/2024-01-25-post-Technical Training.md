technical training started gaining importance in the 1950s with Singaporeâ€™s
shift towards export-oriented manufacturing as the main strategy to generate
employment and economic growth.</p>
<p>In 1967, the Britishâ€™s announcement that it would withdraw its forces
from Singapore by the mid-1970s worsened Singaporeâ€™s economic prospect
as British military bases contributed over 20 percent to our gross national
product at the time. When it became clear that the British had no intention
of changing their mind and in fact, brought forward the withdrawal of the
military from the mid-1970s to 1971, the threat of large-scale unemployment
as a result of the withdrawal renewed Singaporeâ€™s drive towards industrialisation.</p>
<p>Between the late 1960s and 1980s, the government extended technical education
to the secondary level and established more technical and vocational schools.
For those already in the workforce, the focus was on continual upgrading
of skills and certification.</p>
<p>In the 1990s, as Singapore shifted its focus to high value-added industries
and services, a more educated and skilled workforce was needed. Vocational
and technical training were elevated to be taught at the post-secondary
level. The Institute of Technical Education (restructured from the Vocational
and Industrial Training Board) together with the polytechnics embarked
on a journey to revamp their approach to ensure that the technical training
offer opportunities for further studies and career upgrading.</p>
<p>Today, Polytechnics and ITEs go beyond the core of technical training
to provide students with holistic competencies that will enable them to
meet real-world needs. In 2014, the Continuing Education and Training Masterplan
(CET 2000) was renewed to develop learning opportunities and deepen expertise
in the workforce with the support of employers. The SkillsFuture national
movement was launched in the same year to enable Singaporeans to equip
themselves with the knowledge and skills needed for emerging industries.
These initiatives ensure that Singaporeans have opportunities to progress
together and stay versatile and relevant in the workforce.</p>
