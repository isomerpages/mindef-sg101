Joo Chiat was designated as Singapore‚Äôs first ‚ÄúHeritage Town‚Äù in 2011?</p>
<p>Spanning a long history starting from the 1820s, the area (before it was
formally named Joo Chiat) had initially comprised coconut and cotton plantations
and country houses owned by the wealthy.</p>
<p>Its development as a small town burgeoned in the 1900s to 1920s as people
decided to settle there, escaping the overcrowded city centre. These incoming
residents consisted of Peranakan and Eurasian populations, as well as Chinese,
Malay, and Indian communities -- making the town already a melting pot
of cultures and ethnicities in the early days.</p>
<p>This was also when Chew Joo Chiat, who was a wealthy trader from China
and whom the area was eventually named after, acquired large swathes of
land in the area, which the Chew family eventually sold off for residential
and commercial use.</p>
<p>In the 1950s and 60s, modern landmarks such as the Roxy and Odeon cinemas,
department stores, as well as cultural-religious landmarks such as the
Sri Vinayagar Kalamandapam Temple and the Kuan im Tng Temple were built.
Such developments reflected how the area continued to cater residents of
varying backgrounds, while also rapidly modernising to suit modern needs
and sensibilities.</p>
<p>In 1991, the Urban Redevelopment Authority gazetted 518 buildings in Joo
Chiat for conservation -- mainly two-story shophouses and terrace houses.
Further enriching the heritage tapestry of Joo Chiat, additional buildings
also earned their conservation stripes, including bungalows at various
streets such as 25 Chapel Road and 25 Still Road South, St. Hilda‚Äôs Church
and Bethesda (Katong) Church, which had become prominent landmarks in the
area.</p>
<p>That said, Joo Chiat faced difficulties in the early 2000s as an increase
in nightlife locations and shady establishments gave it a sleazy reputation.
Prostitution, fights, and public drunkenness were also rampant. In a remarkable
instance of proactiveness and ownership, residents in the area formed the
‚ÄúSave Joo Chiat Working Group‚Äù in 2004. This group lobbied the government
for change and implemented community watch initiatives, resulting in the
tighter law enforcement in the area and the closure of many bars and massage
parlours, leading to a reduction in vice.</p>
<p>Today, Joo Chiat has undergone a remarkable transformation, with art galleries,
design studios, and boutique hotels rejuvenating the area, and a diverse
culinary scene offering several F&amp;B options suitable for every palette. <strong><a href="https://www.facebook.com/hashtag/ourneighbourhood?__eep__=6&amp;__cft__[0]=AZUultSNxddhAnwlkEZAnBbuqolrGDlQX-ermE8T-7CnTGqu_IjS3Uq8vVy9zm4rnNjCfvq3qAg3HmUWHY8KughfJn6SMUGPefSF_QsOu_9wCxQbRVswiAAKXiG-9o-zgD6aEIYi8dw7l5qRF_xDE_0KCWig1QNf4Da2Zzr75uPGu9orGO-mrGIwvIa_zzvSMfaqgB-nHeuXfah8hCszsn6_&amp;__tn__=*NK-R" class="x1i10hfl xjbqb8w x1ejq31n xd10rxx x1sy0etr x17r0tee x972fbf xcfux6l x1qhh985 xm0m39n x9f619 x1ypdohk xt0psk2 xe8uvvx xdj266r x11i5rnm xat24cr x1mh8g0r xexx8yu x4uap5 x18d9i69 xkhd6sd x16tdsg8 x1hl2dhg xggy1nq x1a2a7pz x1sur9pj xkrqix3 x1fey0fg x1s688f" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">#ourneighbourhood</a></strong> in
Joo Chiat stands for many things that we Singaporeans are proud of -- notable
architectural treasures, rich cultural heritage, a variety of ethnic and
cultural cuisines, and in more recent times, the desire and can-do attitude
to seek change for the better and improve our lives. From its history,
Joo Chiat stands proud as a microcosm of our Singapore, and ensures a positive
and lasting legacy for generations to come.</p>
