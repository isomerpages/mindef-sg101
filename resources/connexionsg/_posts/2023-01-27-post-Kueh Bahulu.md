The Kueh Bahulu is a light and fluffy egg-based pastry often shaped like stars, fishes, flowers, and seashells. The kueh is usually shaped like a fish during Chinese New Year as the Chinese word for fish, 鱼 (Yú), sounds similar to the word for abundance, 余 (Yú). As the main ingredient in Kueh Bahulu is egg, it is sometimes known as egg sponge cake.

Its trademark lightness comes from careful preparation of the flour used to make it, which is either sun-dried or dry-fried in a pan to remove excess moisture. Due to its relatively low sugar content, the Bahulu is soft and spongy on the inside and slightly crusty on the outside.

Traditionally, Kueh Bahulu was made in heavy seasoned brass moulds and heated over a charcoal fire. Nowadays, however, many people prepare the treat with aluminium moulds and ovens instead.

In Singapore, Kueh Bahulu is a crowd-pleaser during the festive seasons. It is often enjoyed as a festive snack during Hari Raya Puasa and Chinese New Year. Singaporeans will likely be the most familiar with the Bahulu Cermai, but this delightful treat also comes in roll-shaped (Bahulu Gulung) and layered (Bahulu Lapis) variations.
