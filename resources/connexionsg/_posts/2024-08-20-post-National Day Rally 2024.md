<p>Did you catch Prime Minister Lawrence Wongâ€™s maiden National Day Rally
speech on Sunday? Here are our key takeaways and how they may matter to
you!
<br>
</p>
<p>1) Students will get more support to grow their potential in diverse areas.
It is important to refocus on the fundamental objectives of education,
which are to spark joy for learning and to help every child realise their
full potential. To do this, there will be increased academic and non-academic
opportunities for students to grow their passions and thrive.
<br>
<br>2) Singapore will become more family-friendly than before. Our society
is ageing and our family sizes are shrinking. There will be more support
for families through every stage of life, such as continued access to affordable
public housing and new shared parental leave.
<br>
<br>3) Continuous learning and skills upgrading will be the way to go. There
will be more support for workers who want to upgrade their skills, and
those who need help in a competitive economic environment. This encourages
Singaporeans to take ownership of our learning throughout life, and adapt
as the economy transforms so that everyone can make meaningful contributions
to Singapore regardless of our life stage or age.
