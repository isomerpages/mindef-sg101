<p>#OnThisDay (1 Nov) 50 years ago, the Five Power Defence Arrangements (FPDA)
between Singapore, Malaysia, Australia, New Zealand and the United Kingdom
came into effect. The pact established defence cooperation between members
following the withdrawal of British troops from the region.</p>
<p>Over the years, this partnership has withstood the test of time, with
regular joint exercises to ensure our militaries can respond as one if
the need arises. Key military personnel and defence ministers also engage
in regular dialogue through the FPDA Consultative Council, the FPDA Defence
Chiefs' Conference and FPDA Defence Ministers' Meeting.</p>
<p>Against a fluid and ever-evolving security landscape, the exercises and
discussions have incorporated issues such as counter-terrorism, maritime
security and HADR (Humanitarian Assistance and Disaster Relief) over the
years. This ensures the FPDA is adapting to the contemporary security environment.</p>
<p>The collaborative spirit of the FPDA has fostered trust and mutual understanding
between all members and will continue to contribute to peace and security
in the region. As we celebrate 50 years of the world's second-oldest military
partnership, we remember the importance of having friends â€” especially
those who share a common goal for security and stability in this region.
