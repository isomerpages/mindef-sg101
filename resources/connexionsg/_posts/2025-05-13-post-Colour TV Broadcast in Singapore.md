<p>It’s hard to imagine now, but there was a time, before the sleek flat
screens and personal devices we have today. Colour television (TV) programme
transmission first became available in Singapore in May 1974, but colour
TVs only made its way into households just before the FIFA World Cup final
between West Germany and the Netherlands on 7 July 1974. Singapore was
one of the first countries in Southeast Asia to get colour TV broadcasts
of the match. 2,000 units of colour TV sets were sold the day before the
match and there was a sharp rise in the number of colour TV rentals too.</p>
<p>However, colour broadcasting in Singapore only became more common from
1 August 1974 onwards, starting with the programme ‘Anatomy of a Parade’
on Channel 5 at 7.40 pm. Four years later, colour programmes constituted
85% of all programmes.</p>
<p>These days, the Internet and social media take centre stage in global
communications. We no longer have to solely depend on TVs to witness major
local and world events in real time. Though the TV now plays a smaller
role, our TV screens have become bigger and wider, the resolution ever-better:
all to enhance the experience of watching the world from home.</p>

<p>One of the first colour TVs available in Singapore was the Sierra 22 CTV
26 console, encased within a hardwood frame. Imported from Holland, it
cost around $2,400, a considerable amount of money given that the average
monthly salary was between $300 and $500 in the 1970s. Additionally, the
annual licence fee for colour televisions was $54.</p>

<p>The 1974 National Day Parade was the first parade to be televised in colour.
This sparked another frenzy to buy colour TV sets. In fact, the demand
was described by dealers as “better than the rush for colour sets just
before last month’s World Cup soccer final”.

<p>The overhaul of broadcasting infrastructure for colour broadcasts in Singapore
led to the replacement of 90 percent of existing equipment to ensure compatibility
with colour transmission standards. A whopping $20 million was set aside
for this endeavour.</p>
