Escape the city hustle and bustle this #SundayFunday!

Discover the hidden gem of Yishun Dam, a tranquil oasis built in 1983, serving as one of Singapore's largest water sources. Nestled between the pristine waters of Lower Seletar Reservoir and the Johor Strait, this scenic location offers a serene escape from the crowds.

Dust off those sports shoes and embark on a leisurely stroll or cycle along the dam. Situated at one end of Yishun Dam is the Rowerâ€™s Bay Park, a picturesque two-kilometre lakeside boardwalk with tall reeds and willow trees. Enjoy the fresh air and reconnect with nature.

Another activity that visitors enjoy is fishing and angling, so join in the fun and cast your lines to see what you can reel in. Keep your eyes peeled for thrilling moments as you may catch planes taking off and landing from the nearby Seletar Airport or spot rare birds like the White Collared Kingfisher and Grey Heron.

You can also immerse in the breath-taking view of the reservoir while witnessing the sun set in the horizon. It's the perfect spot for picnics and barbeques, creating cherished memories with friends and family. As night falls, stay for a magical stargazing experience. Embrace the tranquillity as you have heart-to-heart conversations with your loved ones.

Plus, seize the opportunity to capture stunning OOTD shots at various picturesque spots! Don't be surprised when your friends flood your socials with curious comments about this enchanting location.

Slow down and savour the #SundayFunday at Yishun Dam - a place where nature's beauty unfolds!
