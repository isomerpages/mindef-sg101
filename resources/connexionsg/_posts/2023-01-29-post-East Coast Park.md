Stretching out from the city to Xilin Avenue in Bedok, the East Coast Park is a beach and a park encompassing Marine Parade, Bedok and Tampines, along the south-eastern coast of Singapore. Looking out towards the sea in the south, the breezy, beachside park attracts droves of visitors looking for some fun and food each weekend.

Opened in the 1970s, the East Coast Park is built entirely on reclaimed land with a man-made beach. The beach is protected by breakwaters. The park is connected to Changi Beach Park by the Coastal Park Connector Network, a park connector running along Tanah Merah Coast Road.

The East Coast Park is divided into eight areas, A to H. It is one of Singapore’s largest parks, and is a popular place for families and friends to relax and enjoy themselves. The park has barbecue pits, entertainment facilities such as children’s playgrounds, food centres, and amenities for various sports activities. A cycling and inline skating track runs along the perimeter of the park, which measures over 15 kilometres long. Visitors can also fish at the Bedok Jetty.
