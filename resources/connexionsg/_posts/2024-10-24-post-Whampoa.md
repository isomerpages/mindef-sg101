<p>Whampoa is a housing estate in the Balestier precinct named after Singapore's
early migrant Hoo Ah Kay, better known as “Whampoa” (Huangpu) after his
hometown in Canton (Guangzhou), China. He was the first and only Chinese
to be an extraordinary member in the Executive Legislative Council, as
well as the consul in Singapore for Russia, China and Japan in the 1800s.
He was also remembered for donating a 23-hectare piece of land for the
establishment of the Botanic Gardens in 1859, which later became Singapore’s
first UNESCO World Heritage Site in 2015.</p>
<p>In the 1800s, the Whampoa estate was used as quarters for Indian convict
labourers and burial grounds for immigrants and patients from the nearby
squatters and hospitals. The land cornering Balestier and Serangoon Roads
was designated for the Chinese Paupers Hospital, later known as Tan Tock
Seng Hospital. In the 1900s, private enterprises and shophouses started
to emerge in the area. The precinct started to evolve into a residential
neighbourhood when the first public housing built by the Singapore Improvement
Trust (SIT) began construction at Lorong Limau in 1932. By the 1970s, as
villagers were resettled into housing estates, the new flats replaced most
of the SIT units at Whampoa, Rayman and Lorong Limau estates.</p>
<p>As one of the older estates in Singapore, those housing blocks in Whampoa
built in the 1970s were mainly long slab blocks consisting of basic, small
flats lined along a common corridor. These were easy and quick to construct,
and were thought to be good for keeping Singapore’s “kampong spirit” alive.
Block 34 Whampoa West, completed in 1971, is one of the longest Housing
&amp; Development Board (HDB) slab blocks in Singapore at 320 metres. Another
prominent landmark is a dragon fountain built in 1973 located at Whampoa
Drive. At four-metres high and cladded with pieces of porcelain shards
and glass, the dragon is depicted as soaring into the sky.</p>
<p>Today, the Whampoa neighbourhood is known for offering a taste of history,
culture and nature. It is also known for its good food – foodies from all
over Singapore make a beeline for the hawker fare at the Whampoa Makan
Place or the many eateries in the area.</p>
<p>More recently, the Whampoa Park was built between Whampoa Road and Whampoa
River, offering a green, open space with playgrounds, a pet park and a
ninja challenge course for youths. Located just next to the Whampoa Community
Club and the Whampoa Park Connector, the park offers a recreational space
with facilities that cater to all ages. The Whampoa River is revitalised
with gabion walls planted with creepers, a rain garden along the sidewalk
and other landscaping features such as planters and cantilever decks that
bring residents closer to the water.</p>
