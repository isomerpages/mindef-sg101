You may remember a classic activity where a school-wide PA announcement about a hypothetical air raid would be made. Lights would be turned off, and classrooms would be a hive of activity with students and teachers taping black trash bags at the windows (in an air raid, lights would present enemy pilots with a target to drop their bombs on).

To mimic wartime food shortages, students would also be rationed steamed sweet potatoes and / or plain porridge for recess to give us a small taste of what meals were like during the war.

We can be thankful that what we experienced on Total Defence Day is not a lived reality for us. Indeed, we cannot take our way of life and the stability we enjoy for granted, as current events in Ukraine show us. This Total Defence Day, let us resolve to continue looking out for one another and safeguarding our nation -- together, we keep Singapore strong!
