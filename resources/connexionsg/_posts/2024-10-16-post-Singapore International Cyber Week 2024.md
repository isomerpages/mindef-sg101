<p>“Every society has its own context, culture, and challenges. But the need
to build trust in the digital domain is universal. Without trust, we will
not be able to reap the dividends from digitalisation.” – this was what
Senior Minister and Coordinating Minister for National Security Teo Chee
Hean said in his opening address at the ongoing Singapore International
Cyber Week (SICW) on 15 October 2024.</p>
<p>#DidYouKnow that the SICW is Asia-Pacific’s most established cybersecurity
event for global policy makers, thought leaders and industry experts? Organised
by the Cyber Security Agency of Singapore, the ninth edition of the SICW,
“Trust and Security in the Digital Era”, is taking place now from 14 to
17 October. It aims to drive critical conversations and partnerships to
foster trust and enhance security in the digital and cyber domain, amid
an increasingly fragmented global landscape.</p>
<p>The SICW showcases Singapore’s ability to bring stakeholders across the
world together for a dialogue, much like the annual Shangri-La Dialogue
- also held in Singapore but for defence and security matters. More importantly,
it underscores Singapore’s commitment to the establishment of a rules-based
multilateral order to build a secure and peaceful cyberspace.</p>
<p>Why is it important for Singapore to do so? We live in a highly digital
world and the risks, threats and challenges in the digital domain are constantly
evolving. We cannot function and thrive in this complex digital domain
without trust, especially as a small and open economy that is enabled by
digitalisation to a large extent.</p>
<p>Given this context, Singapore has to be a consistent stalwart advocate
for a rules-based world order and for international law – and the same
applies to the digital domain. This is also why apart from the SICW, Singapore
also plays an active role in cybersecurity discussions in other platforms,
such as at the United Nations.</p>
<p>And indeed, as we navigate the digital revolution, let us stay committed
on our goal to ensure Singapore remains relevant, and continue to innovate
and transform ourselves to secure our future.</p>
