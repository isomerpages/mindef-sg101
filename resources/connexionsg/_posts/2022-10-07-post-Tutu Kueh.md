Whatâ€™s your favourite sweet treat?  
  
Thought to be Chinese or South Indian in origin, tutu kueh is a traditional steamed rice flour kueh filled with sweet coconut palm sugar or peanut and served on pandan leaves.  
  
The very best tutu kueh are made from ingredients of the highest quality - meaning the freshest coconut or peanut, and the most aromatic pandan leaves. Some of the famous tutu kueh in Singapore, such as Mr Hoâ€™s Tutu Kueh at Bendeemer Shopping Mall, or Tanâ€™s Tu Tu Coconut Cake in Chinatown, make for delicious tea time snacks, with copious amounts of delicious coconut or peanut filling wrapped in fluffy rice flour cake that will be sure to delight our taste buds ðŸ˜‹ðŸ˜‹
