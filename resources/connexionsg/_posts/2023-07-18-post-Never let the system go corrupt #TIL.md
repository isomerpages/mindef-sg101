Every team has its challenges. And every challenge requires its own solution.

The recent cluster of events that have raised eyebrows in our nation have also raised questions. So many questions. And PM Lee Hsien Loong‚Äôs answers in the press conference on 17 July and in Parliament on 3 July reiterate the same takeaways: that good governance is of paramount importance to Singapore.

He said on 17 July: "Sometimes things cluster up, but we make sure we put them right, and I hope I put them right and we will be able to set the right tone for a long time to come. Because we are not just maintaining high standards for one election term or one generation of leaders. You have to make sure that you can maintain this, sustain this, feel that sense of mission and responsibility, and be able to transmit that beyond your term into the next generation, and imbue the next generation of people who come forward to serve as well as people who grow up as mature Singapore citizens and voters to understand that this is how our system works, and this is how it has to work in order for Singapore to succeed.

One of the last, almost, public speeches which Mr Lee Kuan Yew made was when he had his 90th birthday and we gave him a party in Parliament. I mentioned this when I spoke at his memorial service. He was very frail, he was in hospital, he came, and we were all gathered and there was a birthday cake, and he said only two or three sentences. ‚ÄúRemember, never let the system go corrupt. Never, never let that happen. Uphold standards, make sure that Singapore can work.‚Äù That is the key thing, and I am quite determined to do that and I am quite sure the 4G leaders are determined to do that too.‚Äù
