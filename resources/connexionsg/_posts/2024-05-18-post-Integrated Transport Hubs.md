there are eleven Integrated Transport Hubs in Singapore â€“ fully-air-conditioned
and sheltered interchanges that are seamlessly connected to MRT stations
and adjoining residential and commercial developments such as housing estates
and shopping malls.
<br>
<br>
<br>In the early days, bus terminals were owned by individual bus companies
and it was common to see them used as the final stop for buses. The bus
terminals faced challenges such as illegal street hawking, poor hygiene
and lack of facilities. It was only in the 1970s that existing facilities
were upgraded and new amenities like canteens and toilets were built.
<br>
<br>
<br>As housing estates became prevalent and with the first MRT line operational
in the 1980s, the government built regional bus interchanges to be shared
by all the bus operators. In 2002, the first ITH at Toa Payoh was launched
to provide better commuter experience and improve the efficiency of transport
operators. With ITHs, commuters can now have their meals, run errands and
shop at their convenience and in comfort, before transferring to their
connecting buses or trains. No longer are our bus interchanges confined
on the ground, ITHs can be underground too such as the Woodlands ITH. New
and inclusive amenities such as commuter and baby care rooms, wayfinding
signages and heart zones for commuters with special needs can also be found
at some of these ITHs.
<br>
<br>ITHs are an example of how infrastructure planning has evolved over time
to meet citizensâ€™ needs. As our needs evolve, how else might our ITHs evolve?
