<p>Water is essential to life, and access to clean water is one of our most
basic human needs. Yet, millions of people live without access to clean
water. According to 2020 statistics from the United Nations World Water
Development Report 2023, 26% of the world's population (about 2 billion
people) don‚Äôt have access to safe drinking water. In fact, the World Health
Organisation (WHO) shared that some 1 million people are estimated to die
each year from diarrhoea as a result of unsafe drinking-water, sanitation
and hand hygiene.</p>
<p>In 1912, the Straits Times wrote, ‚ÄúSingapore now has one of the finest
water supplies in the world, and to get that on a tiny island which has
no river much bigger than a ditch must have meant long and earnest study
and a fine capacity for making the most of available means.‚Äù True enough,
today, our tap water quality is well within the WHO Guidelines for Drinking-water
Quality, and Singapore Environmental Public Health Regulations 2019.</p>
<p>This access to clean water in Singapore has become so commonplace that
is often <strong><a href="https://www.facebook.com/hashtag/takenforgranted?__eep__=6&amp;__cft__[0]=AZWr9gmOxxKHxG62JyHQKGsdogyofb8C2tHF22uqDhqsyQPHkf64fZHRr0R4cGpKfe-66Rn9PJOBtUks7gkp16JFvWEkmWfoAhrTdRRyM9jzAZYe7SttcqTDNA0Idmla3TgjyOyLVXy59m8cHvSTY4glzf7R_qa1HRqE-YPbU51-3DG7lNzGO5zGC8JV4IQ52pYNBwB8R1AgQb3H8Mj-T1Z5&amp;__tn__=*NK-R" class="x1i10hfl xjbqb8w x1ejq31n xd10rxx x1sy0etr x17r0tee x972fbf xcfux6l x1qhh985 xm0m39n x9f619 x1ypdohk xt0psk2 xe8uvvx xdj266r x11i5rnm xat24cr x1mh8g0r xexx8yu x4uap5 x18d9i69 xkhd6sd x16tdsg8 x1hl2dhg xggy1nq x1a2a7pz x1sur9pj xkrqix3 x1fey0fg x1s688f" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">#TakenForGranted</a></strong>.
Imagine this: you turn on the tap in your homes, and without a second thought,
you drink a glass of the water that comes out ‚Äì because you know that our
tap water is suitable for drinking directly from the tap without any further
filtration.</p>
<p>Yet this access has not always been the case, and did not come naturally.
This is because Singapore is one of the most water-stressed countries in
the world, due to the lack of groundwater and natural freshwater bodies,
as well as limited land for water storage facilities of harvested rainwater.</p>
<p>We have gone through dry spells in the past that reduced our water stocks
so drastically that our taps sometimes ran dry: in 1963 to early 1964,
water levels in Singapore and in the Tebrau River area of Johor plummeted
so low that authorities had to impose restrictions on water use. Another
dry spell in early 1971 led to warnings of water rationing and the launch
of our first ‚ÄúWater is Precious‚Äù campaign as part of our public education
programmes to encourage water conservation.</p>
<p>Today, Singapore is internationally recognised as a model city for water
management and an emerging Global Hydrohub ‚Äì a leading centre for business
opportunities and expertise in water technologies. As our demand for water
grows (roughly 782 Olympic-sized swimming pools of water a day!), coupled
with more erratic weather changes, water shortages could potentially happen
again.</p>
<p>While we appreciate having a robust, diversified and sustainable water
supply from Four National Taps, at the individual level, we should continue
to form good habits in water consumption for we never know when the next
water disruption might be.</p>
