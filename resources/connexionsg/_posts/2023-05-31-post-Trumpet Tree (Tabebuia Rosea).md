Ever wondered which flower is responsible for the occasional display of a pink ‘carpet’ on the grounds of Singapore? Trumpet trees (Scientific name: Tabebuia Rosea) are also called the Pink Poui, or more fondly known as “Singapore’s cherry blossoms”.

The word ‘rosea’ in its genus name refers to the rose-coloured petals of the flower, although the flower is not a rose but in fact, a Begonia.

The Trumpet Tree can grow to approximately 18 to 35 metres tall and is commonly planted along the road or in parks to provide shade. The flowers are five-petalled, trumpet-shaped and grow to about 5 to 8 cm. These bloomed flowers last for several days before they start to wilt. Its name is derived from the trumpet shape of the flowers.

During flowering, the tree is crowned with pink or white blooms. The five-petaled flowers create a spectacular "pink carpet" around the tree when they fall and last for a few days before they start wilting.

It usually flowers due to heavy rains after a dry spell, from March to April and August to September. Unlike the Sakura season in Japan, which only happens in March and April, we might have a chance to catch the second round of blooming in September.
Dreaming of seeing Cherry Blossoms in Japan? Look no further, as we have the ‘Singaporean version’ blooming right here in our streetscape! 🌸

Some areas with clusters of flowering trees are Ulu Pandan canal, Bishan Park, Pasir Ris Park, and Robertson Quay. Have you spotted them blooming elsewhere in Singapore? 🤩
