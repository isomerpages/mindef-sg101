<p>Our trees provide intangible benefits for our livelihood and well-being,
even if we don’t realise it consciously. It would be difficult to imagine
a Singapore without greenery.</p>
<p>So even as Singapore continues to urbanise, we have a responsibility to
be careful stewards of our living environment — for our city, our island's
wildlife and our future generations to come.</p>
