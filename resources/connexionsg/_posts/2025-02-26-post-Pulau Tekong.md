<p>ðŸ“·: Former residential wells which still exists on Pulau Tekong</p>
<p>Mention Pulau Tekong, and most likely you will hear stories that revolve
around Basic Military Training (BMT). After all, the island is dedicated
exclusively to military use today. However, #DidYouKnow that Pulau Tekong
was once filled with kampongs, and a trading station for Pulau Ubin and
the state of Johor?</p>
<p>Located off the northeastern coast of Singapore, Pulau Tekong originally
was made up of two islands, Pulau Tekong Besar and Pulau Tekong Kechil.
The islands were merged in the mid-1990s.</p>
<p>At its peak in the 1980s, Pulau Tekong had a population of 8,000 comprising
mainly Malays with a few Teochews and Hakkas. All the islanders had since
been resettled on the mainland. While the kampongs no longer exist, the
memories live on in the names of training areas such as Selabin, Permatang
and San Yong Kong.</p>
<p>The mangrove forest of Pulau Tekong is one of the largest remaining patches
of mangroves in Singapore undisturbed by human activities. This has enabled
the discovery of critically endangered mangrove species, such as the Bruguiera
hainesii, and the Kandelia candel.</p>
<p>Pulau Tekong is also a stronghold for the elusive leopard cats, which
are critically endangered in Singapore, with fewer than 50 believed to
remain. Just recently, these leopard cats were sighted in Changi, and researchers
said that these wildcats likely swam across from the nearby Pulau Tekong.</p>
<p>Currently, Singaporeâ€™s first tropical polder is being built to protect
Pulau Tekong against rising sea levels. It was envisaged that the project
will allow Singapore to gain experience in developing polders, which could
be an option for coastal protection and resilience against sea-level rise.
This is an important task, given that approximately one-third of Singapore
is less than 16 feet above sea level â€“ low enough for flooding due to climate
change.</p>
<p>From civilian to military needs, and reclamation to preservation, Pulau
Tekong exemplifies Singaporeâ€™s ability to balance diverse land-use demands,
through traits like innovativeness, boldness and a can-do attitude.</p>
