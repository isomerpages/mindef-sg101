<p>You’ve probably seen community cats lounging around your HDB estates.
These cats are part of our shared spaces, living among us.</p>
<p>According to the Cat Welfare Society, Singapore is home to some 60,000
to 80,000 community cats, many of whom are lovingly cared for by regular
feeders. While these cats aren’t pets, they share our environment — so
responsible caregiving matters. This includes sterilisation, feeding responsibly,
and keeping the area clean and sanitary. Care should be thoughtful — not
just for the cats’ welfare, but also for the comfort of fellow residents.</p>
<p>However, not all stories are heartwarming as cat abuse cases continued
to surface as of late. These accounts are troubling and often gory. Recently,
a Member of Parliament called for “stronger laws and enforcement” to better
protect these voiceless lives.</p>
<p>Respect for animals starts with us. Let’s build a more ethical society
by speaking up against animal abuse and cruelty, and promptly reporting
any suspected cases. If you see or suspect animal abuse, immediately call
the Animal &amp; Veterinary Service at 1800-476-1600.</p>
