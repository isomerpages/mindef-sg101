#Didyouknow that Jewel was built right in the heart of Changi Airport without disrupting any of its operations?
This was achieved by a true feat of engineering -- Jewel was constructed downwards level by level while the project teams constantly monitored all adjoining structures to ensure that they were not adversely impacted and airport’s operations were not affected. The dedication to maintain normalcy despite such a large construction project meant that Jewel could be constructed without impacting airport operations and air traffic flow!

But more than just a feat of engineering, Jewel was conceptualised to augment Changi Airport's position as a leading global air hub and as a stopover destination for travellers.

Today, Jewel brings the outdoors indoors, and hosts a unique mix of natural wonders and world-class facilities and attractions imagined to surprise and delight! Fun-laden attractions like the Canopy Park (a giant net suspended 23 metres above ground), the Changi Experience Studio (an indoor virtual theme park), and an indoor spin class draw local visitors and tourists alike to Jewel.

And perhaps the most defining feature is none other than the Rain Vortex, an indoor waterfall which cascades through the heart of Jewel. At a height of 40 metres, this larger-than-life water feature is the world's tallest indoor waterfall that is usually heard before it is seen as visitors and tourists exit the retail and dining zones!

Surrounding the Rain Vortex is also one of Asia’s most extensive indoor gardens, with over 2,000 trees and 100,000 shrubs surrounding the waterfall, including a pair of olive trees from Spain that are at least a hundred years old!

No doubt Jewel will remain the ‘crown jewel’ of our Changi Airport for years to come. And from its conceptualisation to construction, and then to what it currently is today, Jewel stands as a symbol of Singapore’s grit, innovation, and boldness to break new barriers and acheive new heights – indeed, this is the #singaporeway.
