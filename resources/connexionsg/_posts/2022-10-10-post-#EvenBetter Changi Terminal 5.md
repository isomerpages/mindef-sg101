When the COVID-19 pandemic drastically disrupted travel across the globe, plans for Changi Airport‚Äôs mega expansion at Terminal 5 (T5) were also affected.

T5 was to be ready by the mid-2030s, as part of Singapore‚Äôs long-term developments for the aviation sector, which included Changi East development project, a 1,080-hectare development ‚Äî our most significant expansion project in over three decades. But T5‚Äôs design had to change to meet new safety requirements and possible future challenges to the aviation industry.

"Because of all these great uncertainties, we have been doing a major thorough study about aviation, and how it will be like in the next two years, three years, four years, post-pandemic,‚Äù said then-Transport Minister Khaw Boon Wan on 16 June 2020.

The setback resulted in improvements that make T5 #EvenBetter. During this year‚Äôs National Day Rally on 21 August, PM Lee Hsien Loong said that T5 will be pandemic-ready, with the flexibility to operate as smaller sub-terminals, and have spaces that can be used for testing or segregation of high-risk passengers. T5 will be able to scale operations up and down as needed, and operate more safely and flexibly in the event of a future pandemic.

And to support Singapore‚Äôs quest towards environmental sustainability, T5 will decarbonise its operations by adopting solar panels, smart building management systems and district cooling combined with thermal energy storage. It will also support the use of cleaner jet fuels like sustainable aviation fuel.

T5 will be linked to the other terminals at Changi Airport, allowing the expanded Changi Airport to be operated as a single, integrated airport for ease of transfer between different terminals with airfield operational efficiency. New facilities, such as navigation aids, airfield lighting systems and a fire station will also be constructed.

By pressing onwards with Changi Airport's expansion, Singapore sends a clear signal to the world that we are emerging stronger from the pandemic, as a future-proofed aviation hub for this region and the world. #ChangiAirport #Aviation
