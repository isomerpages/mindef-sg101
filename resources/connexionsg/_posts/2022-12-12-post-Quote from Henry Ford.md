December may be when we most feel the clash of deadlines, family time, festivities, holidays, budgets, obligations, and responsibilities that demand our emotional, psychological, and physical strength.

Just a friendly reminder that our challenges bring us ripe opportunities to test our limits and grow our capacity to handle the hustle and bustle of life. The stronger the winds, the further we can go in life. Bon voyage everyone!
