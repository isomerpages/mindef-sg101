National Junior College (NJC) was Singaporeâ€™s first junior college!</p>
<p>The idea behind â€˜Junior Collegesâ€™ (JCs) found its roots in 1965 -- back
then, both secondary and pre-university classes were held in the same location,
resulting in space and resource constraints. Creating JCs as separate campuses
and institutions would ideally alleviate the pressure on space and resource
constraints, and optimise the use of teachers and lab facilities.</p>
<p>Construction on the NJC campus began in 1967 at Linden Drive in Bukit
Timah as the first of four JCs planned. It was slated to have thirty classrooms,
ten science laboratories, two lecture theatres, and various other facilities
catering to 1,200 students. Learning methods were also vastly different.
Instead of large class sizes, small tutorial groups consisting of ten students
each would also be formed to facilitate closer student-teacher interaction.</p>
<p>Since its opening in 1969, NJC has found itself as a pioneer in the field
of Singaporeâ€™s pre-university education. For instance, in 1985, it became
the first junior college in Singapore to introduce the Art Elective Programme
to groom talented arts students while in 1992, it became the first JC to
offer German as part of its Language Elective Programme.</p>
<p>Many more JCs and post-secondary school options were set up over the years
to cater to a wide range of students of varying academic inclinations,
interests, and abilities.</p>
<p>Indeed, NJC can be seen as a pioneer -- a successful experiment to create
a robust post-secondary education pathway, arming our next generation of
Singaporean with a variety of skills and experiences so that they can together
bring our nation forward.</p>
