<p>Mention Jalan Kayu and most Singaporeans would think of its famous crispy
roti prata, thanks to two well-known eateries along the road. But there’s
much more to this street than just prata!</p>
<p>Tucked away in the north-east of Singapore, Jalan Kayu is a two-lane road
about 1.2km long, connecting Yio Chu Kang Road to Seletar West Farmway.
It links the quiet Seletar Hills estate on one end to fish farms and greenery
on the other.</p>
<p>The road has military origins, built in 1928 by the British Royal Air
Force as the main route to RAF Seletar. It was named ‘Jalan Kayu’ by the
Singapore Rural Board in 1937.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>While officially a road, ‘Jalan Kayu’ is often used informally to refer
to the surrounding neighbourhood — including heritage shophouses, local
eateries, and nearby estates like Seletar Hills, Fernvale, and Gerald Drive.</p>
<p>In the early 2000s, part of the Seletar East Farmway area — once accessible
via Jalan Kayu — was redeveloped into the neighbourhood of Fernvale. This
area has seen rapid transformation, but long-time residents would fondly
remember the Seletar Hills Market and Hawker Centre (1975 – 2004) served
as a vibrant community hub.</p>
<p>Adding to the area’s charm are a row of two-storey shophouses, built in
the 1950s. Designed with spiral staircases, basements, and classic metal
gates, these structures evoke a bygone era. These shophouses survive till
this day, and remain a distinctive feature of Jalan Kayu.</p>
<p>Despite its short length, Jalan Kayu is full of character, blending nostalgic
charm with a rich past.</p>
