Spiders are not insects, as they have eight legs instead of six. While most spiders have eight eyes, some have fewer than eight. Spiders do not have ears; they feel the sound vibrations with tiny hairs on their legs. Unlike insects, whose adult bodies are divided into three parts, the spiders have only 2 namely the head and the abdomen. Spiders have a unique feature known as spinnerets which are located at the tip of the abdomen for silk production.

While we sometimes may run across a few spiders that have found their way indoors in search of food and shelter, most spiders prefer living outdoors.

There are actually over 800 species of spiders found in Singapore. Some common type of spiders found here include the Yellow Sac Spider, Wolf Spider and Daddy Longlegs. Rarer spiders such as the Black Widow, Brown Recluse Spider, Garden Spider and Domestic Huntsmen Spider may also be encountered in Singapore.
