#TIL that ‚ÄúSupertrees‚Äù provide a very important function as a green lung for our city! The 18 Supertrees found at the Supertree Grove in Bay South Garden of Gardens by the Bay, are giant tree-like structures, or vertical gardens which dominate the Gardens' landscape with heights ranging from 25 metres to 50 metres. 

Made from reinforced concrete and wrapped in a steel frame, these colossal solar-powered Supertrees perform a multitude of functions, which include planting, shading and working as environmental engines for the gardens.

The Supertrees are sublime in their combination of biodiverse aesthetics, ecological engineering and environmental technologies. Some are equipped with photovoltaic panels that collect energy from the sun to generate electricity for the park and to pump water to the top of the trees. Others helped to collect rainwater for watering of plants, or served as air intake and exhaust towers to help regulate the temperature and humidity within the park and conservatories.

In the day, the Supertrees‚Äô large canopies provide shade and shelter. At night, the Supertrees come alive with a coordinated light and music show known as the Garden Rhapsody ‚Äì a dazzling show which light up the city and can be seen for miles away. The Supertrees are also accompanied by an elevated 128-metre-long aerial walkway ‚Äì the OCBC Skyway ‚Äì which connects two 42-metre Supertrees, offering visitors a different view of the Gardens from a height of 22 metres. Located at the canopy of the tallest 50-metre Supertree, the 3-level Supertree Observatory too, offers a great 360-degree panoramic view of the lush surroundings of Gardens by the Bay and the Marina Bay skyline.

Indeed, the Supertrees is a stunning showcase of horticulture and garden artistry which we can all take pride in. üå≥
