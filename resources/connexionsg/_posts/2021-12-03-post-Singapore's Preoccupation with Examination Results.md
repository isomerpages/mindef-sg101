<p>#TIL that one of our founding fathers had said obsession over "outstanding
results" for Cambridge exams is "a very bad thing".</p>
<p>Singapore's then-Minister for Defence Dr Goh Keng Swee said in a speech
in 1967: "The preoccupation in Singapore with examination results is unnatural
and unhealthy and we should bring it to an end as early as possible. After
all, good performance in examinations only proves one thing -- the ability
to answer examination questions."</p>
<p>He said three aspects of education needed more emphasis in Singapore:</p>
<ol data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p>Creative imagination -- "which is inhibited by parrot-like teaching of
text-books and I hope that abomination of this kind will cease in all of
our schools".</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Character -- because "an intelligent person can have no character; that
is he may be weak and irresolute. Conversely, persons of lesser intelligence
can show a high degree of courage and tenacity when placed in trying or
adverse conditions."</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Moral values -- because "the most successful leaders of pirates, brigands
and gangsters have imagination and character in ample proportion but they,
of course, are sadly lacking in moral stature."</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>"Without a widely accepted code of moral values, Singapore will remain
what it is now -- a community which is basically self-centred and selfish.
Such a community may be alright if it is governed by others but it will
not survive for long as an independent democratic national state if the
more successful citizens continue to place their self-interest before the
interest of the community."</p>
<p>That was 54 years ago. How are we doing today?</p>
