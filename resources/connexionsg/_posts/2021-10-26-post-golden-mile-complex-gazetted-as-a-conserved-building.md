The iconic Gold Mile Complex is here to stay - after being gazetted as a conserved building on 22 Oct 2021.

Between Beach Road and Nicoll Highway stands the Golden Mile Complex. Some may view this building as one of Singapore’s “biggest eyesores” amidst the surrounding tall sleek buildings.  
  
But when Golden Mile Complex was built in 1973, it was seen as revolutionary. Designed in Brutalist style with raw edges, it was one of the first developments to have offices, homes and shops all in one complex. Golden Mile Complex had one of Singapore's biggest theatres, The Golden Theatre, and was a big attraction to Singaporeans looking for entertainment and dining spots.  
  
Over time, however, the complex deteriorated, looking increasingly haphazard as residents added zinc sheets and patch boards to enclose their stepped terraces.  
  
Still, the distinctive structure of Golden Mile Complex is a familiar landmark to Singaporeans. Its presence helps us recognise where we are, and gives us a sense of place. That heritage, built over time, is priceless.
