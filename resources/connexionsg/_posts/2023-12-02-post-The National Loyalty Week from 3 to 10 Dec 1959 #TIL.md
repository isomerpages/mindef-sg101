#TIL about National Loyalty Week, a significant chapter in Singapore's history that took place following Singapore's proclamation as a self-governing state on 3 Jun 1959.

Held between 3 and 10 Dec 1959, the National Loyalty Week was to instil a sense of loyalty to the new state of Singapore. The festivities began with the installation of Yusof bin Ishak as the first Malayan-born Yang di-Pertuan Negara (Head of State) on 3 Dec 1959, and the introduction of some familiar national symbols which have been emblematic of the values Singaporeans uphold, such as:

National Anthem: Heard for the very first time on 3 Dec on the steps of City Hall, "Majulah Singapura‚Äù inspires progress and unity.

üá∏üá¨ State Flag: The iconic red-and-white state flag symbolises universal brotherhood, equality, and purity. The crescent moon represents an eternally young state, while the five stars embody democracy, peace, progress, justice, and equality.

State Crest: The crest features a shield with five white stars and a white crescent moon on a red background. The lion and tiger flanking the shield symbolise Singapore as the lion city and the close ties with Malaya.

These events on 3 Dec 1959 were brought to the forefront through a speech delivered by the former Prime Minister, Mr Lee Kuan Yew. In his speech, he urged the people of Singapore to unite under the national flag, national anthem, and coat of arms, and demonstrate their loyalty towards the country.
