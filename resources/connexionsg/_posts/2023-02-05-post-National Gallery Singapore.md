The National Gallery Singapore is one that every Singaporean has to visit at least once — to admire the immaculate architecture, appreciate the wide range of art collections or simply take a ton of Instagram-worthy photos.

Located in the heart of the civic district, National Gallery Singapore (@nationalgallerysingapore) marries two of our most iconic monuments – the former Supreme Court and City Hall buildings.

The National Gallery draws from the National Collection, one of the world's largest public collections of modern and contemporary Southeast Asian artworks. It is home to two permanent galleries: the Singapore Gallery and the Southeast Asia Gallery.

The Singapore Gallery provides an avenue for studying and presenting the cultural and aesthetic identity of Singapore from the ancient period to present day. The collection now spans from early-20th-century naturalistic paintings to contemporary video installations.

Housed in the former Supreme Court building, the Southeast Asia Gallery presents the history of Southeast Asian art, starting in the 19th century. The collection also holds pieces from Southeast Asian artists of international standing, such as: Affandi (Indonesia), Latiff Mohidin (Malaysia), Le Pho (Vietnam), Montien Boonma (Thailand), Fernando Cueto Amorsolo (Philippines), and Raden Saleh (Indonesia).

The National Gallery Singapore also houses a special set of research galleries. These galleries complement the core galleries and provide space for curators and researchers to experiment with ways of presenting materials from the Gallery's permanent collection.

Besides its permanent galleries and collections, National Gallery Singapore also periodically refreshes its gallery spaces by hosting international travelling exhibitions.

The National Gallery Singapore unravels a side of our nation’s past and present in such detail that one can’t simply read or hear about. You would have to see it for yourself during [#SundayFunday](https://www.instagram.com/explore/tags/sundayfunday/)!
