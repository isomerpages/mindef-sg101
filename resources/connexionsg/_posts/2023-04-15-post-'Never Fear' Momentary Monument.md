At Block 313 in Sembawang stands an intriguing sculpture. It is the Never Fear marker that commemorates a famous speech made by our first Prime Minister, Mr Lee Kuan Yew on 12 Sep 1965 at the original site of Sree Narayana Mission.

He said â€œOver 100 years ago, this was a mud-flat, swamp. Today, this is a modern city. 10 years from now, this will be a metropolis! Never fear."

He was right. And the Never Fear marker is there to remind Singaporeans to continue building our country with that same spirit of courage and grit. The marker was designed by a team of students -- Ahmad Nazaruddin Bin Abdul Rahim (NUS); Wong Qi Rong, Gabrielle (NUS); Goh Ee En, Matz (SP); Goh Ee Yan, Eion (SUTD); Sim I-En, Grace (SUTD) -- who won a design competition held during Singapore's Bicentennial Year 2019 among local tertiary institutions.

It is called a momentary monument, because at certain angles, the sculpture disappears. The two bodies face different directions - one towards the past, one towards the future. But which is which? And what does the disappearing mean? This thought-provoking sculpture inspires reflection on where you stand, and what you see.
