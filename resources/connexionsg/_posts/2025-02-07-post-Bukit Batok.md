<p>Nestled in the western region of Singapore, Bukit Batok boasts a rich
history reflected in its natural landscape. Its name was derived from the
Malay words: ‘bukit’ meaning ‘hill’, and ‘batok’ referring to the granite
or rocky nature of the hill.</p>
<p>A key historical site is Bukit Batok Hill (present-day Bukit Batok Nature
Reserve), which was built around a former quarry. Located west of the Amoy
Canning Corporation factory and the former Poh Hin Granite Quarry and partly
owned by the Hume Pipe Company — played a central role in the area’s early
industrial activities and witnessed its evolving narrative.</p>
<p>During the Japanese Occupation in World War II, the hill became the site
of two poignant memorials. The first, the Syonan Chureito, was a Shinto
shrine built in 1942 by about 500 Australian prisoners-of-war to honour
fallen Japanese soldiers. Behind it stood the British Memorial Cross, a
wooden cross dedicated to fallen Allied soldiers. Both were demolished
in 1945 by the Japanese before the British returned. Today, only two nondescript
pillars and the original 125 steps remain, now guiding visitors to the
modern Bukit Batok Transmission Tower.</p>
<p>Another enchanting facet of Bukit Batok is the Bukit Batok Town Park —
a landscaped park with natural granite rock formations that is often referred
to by locals as Little Guilin, due to its similarity to the actual Guilin
in China. Its rugged granite outcrops, sculpted by erosion over time, and
a serene lake create a picturesque backdrop perfect for photography enthusiasts.</p>
<p>As you explore Bukit Batok, you'll notice that history isn’t confined
to plaques and memorials — it lives in the community. The town’s evolution
from an industrial quarrying site to a modern residential hub encapsulates
Singapore’s broader journey of development and sustainable urban planning.
Today, Bukit Batok is celebrated for its harmonious blend of old and new,
where traditional values meet contemporary living.</p>
