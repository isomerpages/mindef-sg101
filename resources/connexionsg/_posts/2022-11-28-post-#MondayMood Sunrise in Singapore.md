“There is a moment in every dawn when light floats, there is the possibility of magic. Creation holds its breath.” ― Douglas Adams

Sunrise in Singapore flares between 6.49am and 6.51am this week. Rise and shine!

It’s always a fascinating moment when the skies turn from dark to light blue and then to a pastel blend of pinks and oranges.

Waking up earlier can open up time to prepare a healthy breakfast and/or for morning exercise. Healthy, high-protein breakfast options with low sugar content have been shown to improve energy levels throughout the day. People who eat breakfast feel more alert in the morning and tend to be in a better mood than those who skip this meal.

Will you get great ideas while watching a spectacular light show in cool, clean air? Only one way to find out. See you at dawn!
