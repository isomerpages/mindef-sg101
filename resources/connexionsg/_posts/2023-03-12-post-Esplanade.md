#DidYouKnow the Esplanade was described as “ugly concrete blobs”, “bread loaf”, and “marshmallow blobs” before it was built?

The Esplanade’s original design was presented to the public in 1994 as two clear glass structures that could take in views of the area, but critics warned that the lack of cover would turn them into greenhouses in Singapore’s tropical climate. Eventually, over 7000 spiky aluminium sunshades were added to the final design, resulting in a unique architectural icon that resembled two halves of our beloved fruit, the durian.

The Esplanade’s has large theatres with world-class acoustics, outdoor performing areas, an exhibition gallery, a rehearsal studio and Singapore’s first performing arts library – library@esplanade. There is also a mall with retail, lifestyle, and dining areas. The Esplanade’s Concert Hall was listed as one of the “World’s 15 Most Beautiful Concert Halls” by Hamburg-based building data company, Emporis.

This #SundayFunday, try checking out the range of free and paid programmes and performances at the Esplanade, wander around the area that attracts people from all over the world, and tell someone the Esplanade’s story of transforming “flaws” into attractive features, much like Singapore’s own story as a nation.
