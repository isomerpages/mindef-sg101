Sentosa Island was once known as 'Pulau Blakang Mati,' or “the island behind
which lies death”? According to some, Sentosa was infested with pirates
in the past, leading to frequent looting and bloodshed, thus lending it
its ominous name. In the late 1960s, the island was proposed to be redeveloped
for commercial use, and a renaming contest was held in 1972. The name Sentosa
– meaning ‘peace and tranquillity’ in Malay – emerged as the overall winner.
<br>
<br>During World War II, Sentosa played a significant role as a defence outpost
and military base. Today, Fort Siloso is Sentosa’s only remaining coastal
fort and the only complete fort in Singapore. One would be able to see
an intricate network of tunnels, gun batteries, and bunkers in the fort
that saw action during the battle at this military museum which is accessible
to the public.
<br>
<br>Other former World War II buildings which have been converted for hospitality
include Capella Singapore (which hosted the historic 2018 North Korea–United
States Singapore Summit) and The Barracks Hotel. <strong><a href="https://www.facebook.com/hashtag/til?__eep__=6&amp;__cft__[0]=AZU8u4hW9kcboh5VjvQdTT-C9GlWNwPrm1S8WLc4jrjnoG0URU3h_sLui8u0-y7J73PAxlnLtyZrWIm2ejBMEtZZkBxCwTmOg7Vnyefdd_-w-pevH-YfbxOxyqaG2NtQtTmbnYdWR21XDhgnDkBjA25BdmeS-OiB2mWUBT7m4A0SK7TtyVJSC9aM02t-Y3LonAtuyFDLI5tOxJ_cD6aZXNTD&amp;__tn__=*NK*F" class="x1i10hfl xjbqb8w x1ejq31n xd10rxx x1sy0etr x17r0tee x972fbf xcfux6l x1qhh985 xm0m39n x9f619 x1ypdohk xt0psk2 xe8uvvx xdj266r x11i5rnm xat24cr x1mh8g0r xexx8yu x4uap5 x18d9i69 xkhd6sd x16tdsg8 x1hl2dhg xggy1nq x1a2a7pz x1sur9pj xkrqix3 xzsf02u x1s688f" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">#TIL</a></strong> that
the building which now hosts Madame Tussauds Singapore was a former hospital
for British troops!
<br>
<br>Beyond its façade, Sentosa is also home to a rich biodiversity, with approximately
20 hectares of coastal marine habitats and 40 hectares of protected nature
areas and more than 24 heritage trees. In fact, one can commonly see peacocks
strutting around on Sentosa island, which is believed to have the largest
number of peacocks in a single location in Singapore!
<br>
<br>From a military base to a 500-hectare island resort with an exciting array
of themed attractions, award-winning resort accommodation, lush greenery,
golden sandy beaches, world-renowned championship golf courses and deep-water
yachting marina and luxury residences, Sentosa’s transformation and continued
renewal is something we can all take pride in.
<br>
<br>Fun fact: No island admission fees are charged if you enter via the Sentosa
Boardwalk! Let us know your favourite memories of Sentosa in the comments
