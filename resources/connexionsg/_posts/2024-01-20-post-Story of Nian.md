An estimated 2 billion people celebrate the Lunar New Year across the globe every year. One of the most important festivals for the Chinese communities, the Lunar New Year embraces a rich tapestry of practices and traditions, and reinforces cultural values such as family harmony, social bonds, and the pursuit of good fortune for the coming year.

Traditionally, homes are decorated with firecrackers 🧨, lanterns 🏮 and red coloured decorations 🧧during this festival. Many existing customs of the festival can be traced back to a popular folklore of the beast Nian (年), which is believed to be one of the reasons how the festival is celebrated today with loud noises and bright red colours!!
