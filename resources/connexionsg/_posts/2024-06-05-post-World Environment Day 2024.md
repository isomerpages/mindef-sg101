<p>Have you been feeling the heat?
<br>
<br>Indeed, 2023 was by far the warmest year since global records began in
1850, with global average temperature measuring 1.58 degree celsius above
the average in the 1850-1900 pre-industrial period.
<br>
<br>Situated near the Equator, Singapore (and Singaporeans) have certainly
not been spared. Worryingly, temperatures in our island have increased
by 0.24 degree celsius per decade. While the number seems small, they do
add up over time. Assuming that temperatures increase at a constant rate–a
very bold assumption–our mean daily temperature could rise from 27.9 degree
celsius to 32.9 degree celsius by the end of this century, making our living
environment even more extreme and difficult.
<br>
<br>Globally, rising temperatures lead to a whole host of problems, such as
increased frequency and strength of extreme weather events (like floods,
droughts, and storms), rising sea levels, heat stress, and increased pathogenic
activity. All these threaten not just humankind, but all sentient life
on earth.
<br>
<br>This problem has not gone unnoticed, with more people, businesses, non-government
organisations, and governments advocating for environmental causes. World
Environment Day, celebrated annually <strong><a href="https://www.facebook.com/hashtag/onthisday?__eep__=6&amp;__cft__[0]=AZVw72k3wwO_lYvB5nnhSq200nUrOF1RQlhyeUUsWidJekgHfzQEpt0A0OYgtYJt3AFvong_Q4YD2r6sKyspRbTQ9UZJSrwf4yYcPXqcVSpVvsth9_liVc7Ytenrha7B7cQhF8lYNI7MjYBtey-fhnoYF904-V2NRfNdxuc6f2nWWVRwXTg-EPLIUKJnws5-H1I&amp;__tn__=*NK*F" class="x1i10hfl xjbqb8w x1ejq31n xd10rxx x1sy0etr x17r0tee x972fbf xcfux6l x1qhh985 xm0m39n x9f619 x1ypdohk xt0psk2 xe8uvvx xdj266r x11i5rnm xat24cr x1mh8g0r xexx8yu x4uap5 x18d9i69 xkhd6sd x16tdsg8 x1hl2dhg xggy1nq x1a2a7pz x1sur9pj xkrqix3 xzsf02u x1s688f" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">#OnThisDay</a></strong> puts
a global spotlight on the pressing environmental challenges of our times.
<br>
<br>Established by the UN in 1972, World Environment Day has become the largest
global platform for environmental outreach, with governments, businesses
and citizens from more than 150 countries celebrating environmental action
and committing to create a more sustainable world.
<br>
<br>This year, World Environment Day is hosted by Saudi Arabia, with a focus
on land restoration, desertification, and drought resilience.
<br>
<br>As a low-lying tropical island state, Singapore takes the impact of climate
change very seriously. The Singapore Green Plan 2030, or the Green Plan,
is a whole-of-nation movement to advance Singapore’s national agenda on
sustainable development. Spearheaded by five ministries, the Ministries
of Sustainability and the Environment (MSE), Trade and Industry (MTI),
Transport (MOT), National Development (MND), and Education (MOE), and supported
by the whole of Government, the Green Plan charts ambitious and concrete
targets for the rest of this decade.
<br>
<br>This World Environment Day, while we hope for change from all levels of
government and society, let us also play our part as individuals to build
a more sustainable world. We do this not just for ourselves, but also for
our children and future generations, so that they may continue to enjoy
this great planet we live on.</p>
