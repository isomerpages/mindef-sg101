<p>#Didyouknow that Jewel was built right in the heart of Changi Airport
without disrupting any of its operations?</p>
<p>This was achieved by a true feat of engineering -- Jewel was constructed
downwards level by level while the project teams constantly monitored all
adjoining structures to ensure that they were not adversely impacted and
airport’s operations were not affected. The dedication to maintain normalcy
despite such a large construction project meant that Jewel could be constructed
without impacting airport operations and air traffic flow!</p>
<p>But more than just a feat of engineering, Jewel was conceptualised to
augment Changi Airport's position as a leading global air hub and as a
stopover destination for travellers.</p>
<p>Today, Jewel brings the outdoors indoors, and hosts a unique mix of natural
wonders and world-class facilities and attractions imagined to surprise
and delight! Fun-laden attractions like the Canopy Park (a giant net suspended
23 metres above ground), the Changi Experience Studio (an indoor virtual
theme park), and an indoor spin class draw local visitors and tourists
alike to Jewel.</p>
<p>And perhaps the most defining feature is none other than the Rain Vortex,
an indoor waterfall which cascades through the heart of Jewel. At a height
of 40 metres, this larger-than-life water feature is the world's tallest
indoor waterfall that is usually heard before it is seen as visitors and
tourists exit the retail and dining zones!</p>
<p>Surrounding the Rain Vortex is also one of Asia’s most extensive indoor
gardens, with over 2,000 trees and 100,000 shrubs surrounding the waterfall,
including a pair of olive trees from Spain that are at least a hundred
years old!</p>
<p>No doubt Jewel will remain the ‘crown jewel’ of our Changi Airport for
years to come. And from its conceptualisation to construction, and then
to what it currently is today, Jewel stands as a symbol of Singapore’s
grit, innovation, and boldness to break new barriers and achieve new heights
– indeed, this is the #singaporeway.</p>
