<p>Did you know that Sisters' Islands, located just off the southern coast
of Singapore, hold a special place in the heart of our nation? Comprising
Pulau Subar Laut (Big Sister’s Island) and Pulau Subar Darat (Little Sister’s
Island), the Sisters’ Islands are steeped in history, legends, and are
home to incredible biodiversity.</p>
<p>Legend has it that there were two devoted sisters named Minah and Linah,
who drowned in a storm trying to save each other after Linah was abducted
by a pirate chief who wanted her hand in marriage. When the storm stopped,
the sisters were nowhere to be found, but two islands had emerged at the
spot where they had perished. The villages named them Sisters’ Islands.
Today, Sisters’ Islands serve as a hub for conservation, outreach, education
and recreation. In 2014, Sisters’ Islands was designated as Singapore’s
first marine park. Spanning 40 hectares (that’s about the size of 50 football
fields!), it includes the western reefs of St John’s Island and Pulau Tekukor,
a former ammunition dump.</p>
<p>The Sisters’ Islands Marine Park plays a vital role in Singapore's marine
conservation efforts, especially our stunning coral reefs. In fact, our
waters are home to more than 250 species of hard corals, which is almost
32% of hard coral species found worldwide. Key initiatives include coral
restoration through nurseries that cultivate and transplant corals to enhance
reef resilience, and the protection of endangered species like the Giant
Clam and Hawksbill turtle. If you’re lucky, you might spot Hawksbill sea
turtles nesting on the shores! The park also serves as a hub for marine
biodiversity research and public education. These efforts not only protect
and restore marine habitats but also engage the public in preserving Singapore’s
natural heritage​.</p>
<p>Sisters’ Islands Marine Park is currently closed for rejuvenation but
is set to reopen in 2024 with exciting new features. Visitors can look
forward to exploring a new forest trail and snorkeling in a lagoon, cultivating
one’s sense of connection with mother nature. NParks is working to increase
accessibility to the island, and ensure that more people can experience
its rich biodiversity and tranquil beauty once it reopens​.</p>
