The Bugis and the neighbouring Kampong Gelam precinct is a vibrant oasis of colours filled with rich culture and heritage at every turn.

And amongst all the vibrance, there is a collection of art, with local artists from far and wide across Singapore finding their inspiration in this cultural gem.
The mural-covered streets are arguably the precinctâ€™s biggest draw, with paint and musings splattered across almost every street. The area acts like a public and outdoor art exhibition!

One of the more popular streets in the area is Haji Lane. While browsing the murals along Haji Lane, you can make pit stops on all the corner-end stalls and bistros. Rich with authentic Malay food and culture, the mini bazaar-like setting creates an eclectic atmosphere.

Hoping to take a photo with the murals in the graffiti-tagged lane without too many people around? Then definitely come out (very) early in the day on a #SundayFunday! The colourful shops and murals in Haji Lane make for a very Instagram-able photo backdrop ðŸ“¸
