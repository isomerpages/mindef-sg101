Earth Hour is the global movement to raise awareness and unite people to
take action on environmental issues and protect the planet. It began as
a lights out event in Sydney, Australia on 31 March 2007. Since then, the
event has inspired and garnered support from millions of people from more
than 185 countries and territories. <strong><a href="https://www.facebook.com/hashtag/earthhour?__eep__=6&amp;__cft__[0]=AZWWSDDbVXOAoV3simD4ZQlL3-2yOnAyh3eHL2QDCaPYq3STlWUVQfoK95Y6F9s_DRBGOY9s1ufjEaMT5e0OlOSU9co3IE0ZNN0OAcjYyyOCpcmPKMXWfxdMhLjyHodUHrnJLJDqBiB0sPguwSkdmrI1UOrMZJb5Puf4TwvjGTCTxPTlVqQYAAhw1Y_DxOmiRS95VqxS6-1tvdfxJiBo8bcB&amp;__tn__=*NK*F" class="x1i10hfl xjbqb8w x1ejq31n xd10rxx x1sy0etr x17r0tee x972fbf xcfux6l x1qhh985 xm0m39n x9f619 x1ypdohk xt0psk2 xe8uvvx xdj266r x11i5rnm xat24cr x1mh8g0r xexx8yu x4uap5 x18d9i69 xkhd6sd x16tdsg8 x1hl2dhg xggy1nq x1a2a7pz x1sur9pj xkrqix3 xzsf02u x1s688f" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">#EarthHour</a></strong> takes
place annually at the end of March. This year, the one-hour switch off
event will happen on 23 March.
<br>
<br>In Singapore, our beautiful city skyline goes dark for an hour every year
to commemorate Earth Hour and show our support for a climate-resilient
planet. But doing our part for the environment requires more than simply
flipping off a switch. It means forming good habits and making deliberate
choices in our daily lives.
<br>
<br>Singapore’s commitment to environmental sustainability started way back
in the early days of independence. Campaigns such as “Keep Singapore Clean”
and “Tree Planting Day” were introduced. The effort to promote environmental
stewardship was taken further in the 1990s with the Clean and Green campaign
– we conducted recycling drives, beach clean-ups and cleanliness competitions
for housing blocks. Over the years, we have learnt to practise good habits
daily by taking public transport to reduce carbon emissions, saying “no”
to straws and plastic bags and re-using tote bags, recycling rainwater
for non-potable purposes such as for toilet flushing, switching off the
lights and power when we do not need them. These are but some of the ways
that we can play a part to protect the environment that we live in.
<br>
<br>Let's not underestimate the power of small gestures. Every little action
counts when it comes to saving the earth – because it is the only home
that we have.
