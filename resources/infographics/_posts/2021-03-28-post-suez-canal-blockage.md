Seaborne trade has been an important lifeline for Singapore since our early days. Every year, more than 130,000 ships call at Singapore, helping to bring in supplies here and to the region.

When incidents like the #SuezCanalBlockage happen, such supplies may be disrupted. The ensuing domino effect illustrates the interconnectedness of today’s world economy and emphasises the need to be prepared for any contingency.
