On 1 July, we commemorate SAF Day and reaffirm our loyalty and commitment to the SAF and Singapore. 

In this **SAF Day 2023 NE Engagement package**, we cover the need for a long-term view on defence, MINDEF-SAF’s ongoing efforts to strengthen Singapore, and how NS remains the cornerstone of Singapore’s defence.
