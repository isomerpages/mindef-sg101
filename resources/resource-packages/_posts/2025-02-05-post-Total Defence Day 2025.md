<p>Singapore faces an increasingly complex and dangerous world which can
undermine our peace, security and unity. Total Defence remains crucial
and relevant&nbsp;as a whole-of-nation framework where all Singaporeans
can step up and play our part to strengthen our resilience and resolve
in the face of these evolving challenges and threats.</p>
<p>Exercise Singapore Ready will be conducted from 15 to 28 Feb 2025, with
a focus on power disruption and cybersecurity. It aims to strengthen our
resilience in the event of disruptions and over&nbsp;600 organisations
are taking part.</p>
