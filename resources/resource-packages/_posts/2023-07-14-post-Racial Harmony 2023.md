In recent years, incidents relating to racial discrimination and insensitivity have made headlines. Many Singaporeans, including our leaders, have spoken up against such acts.

Every year on 21 Jul, we commemorate Racial Harmony Day to remind ourselves to not let racial differences divide us, and instead turn diversity into our source of strength.

You are encouraged to use this package to discuss the importance of racial harmony in Singapore, and how we can play a part to strengthen racial and religious harmony in our own circles.
