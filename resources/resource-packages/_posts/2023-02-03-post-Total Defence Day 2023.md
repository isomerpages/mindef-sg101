#### Total Defence Day 2023 NE Engagement Package


The theme for 2023’s Total Defence campaign - **“Together We Keep Singapore Strong”** - focuses on the many ways we can put Total Defence into action in our everyday lives.

Total Defence remains relevant to deal with the ever-evolving threats and challenges to Singapore. These include misinformation, supply chain disruptions and food security that affect communities and Singaporeans’ way of life.

Every Singaporean has a part to play in our daily lives to ensure that Singapore is prepared for crises or disruptions, and that we remain resilient and united.
