<p>Every year on 21 Jul, we commemorate Racial Harmony Day to remind ourselves
that everyone has a role to play to build a harmonious society, and that
our diversity can be a source of strength for the common good.</p>
<p>You are encouraged to use this package to discuss the importance of racial
harmony in Singapore, and how we can all play a part to strengthen racial
and religious harmony in our own circles.</p>
