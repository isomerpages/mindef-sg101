2024 marks 40 years of Total Defence (TD40) in Singapore, since it was first introduced in 1984. The theme for this year's Total Defence campaign - "Together We Keep Singapore Strong" - focuses on the many ways we can put Total Defence into action in our everyday lives.

Total Defence remains relevant to deal with the ever-evolving hybrid threats and challenges to Singapore. These include misinformation, supply chain disruptions and food security that affect communities and Singaporeans' way of life.

Every Singaporean has a part to play in our daily lives to ensure that Singapore is prepared for crises or disruptions, and that we remain resilient and united.

To mark this milestone, a new TD40 logo has been developed for the use of all Total Defence-related activities in 2024. For more details on the TD40 logo colours and their usage, you may download the CI Guide and Logo [here](https://go.gov.sg/td40logo). 

Below are other resources on Total Defence which you may find useful for your engagement.

#### **Exercise SG Ready**
![Exercise SG Ready](/images/Ex_SG_Ready_OOH_Posters.jpg)

The inaugural Exercise SG Ready will be held at various locations across the island **between 15 Feb to 29 Feb 2024** to increase Singaporeans' readiness for crises and disruptions. The exercise simulates disruptions of power, water, food supply, digital connectivity and a civil emergency arising from wide spread cyberattacks, disinformation campaigns and drone attacks from an anonymous actor in the region. 

The aim of the exercise is to get individuals, communities and businesses thinking about the question, ***"Are you ready for disruptions?",*** and to put Total Defence into action by putting in place their own contingency plans for disruptions.

#### **Exercise SG Ready Scenario Video**
As part of Exercise SG Ready, the scenario video will illustrate how hybrid threats can disrupt our daily lives. It also helps set the context for the simulated disruptions happening beween 15 - 29 Feb 2024!

Are you game for something new? The Total Defence Tower Defence Game (TDTDG), an online strategy game, was conceptualised and devised by a dynamic group of youths from NUS High School of Mathematics and Science. 

The game adds a Total Defence-themed twist to the classic tower defence game where players need to allocate resources to build towers to defend their territories against enemy attacks. In the TDTDG, players have to defend Singapore against various threats. The threats have been designed to showcase how the six pillars of Total Defence: Military, Civil, Economic, Social, Digital and Psychological Defence, come into play and highlight how everyone has a part to play in defending Singapore. 

The TDTDG is the 4th ground-up initiative to be implemented under the Total Defence Sandbox (TD Sandbox).

**Sports and National Defence - a commentary written by Mr Nicholas Fang**

George Orwell famously wrote that sports is "war minus the shooting". While the celebrated writer meant that sports at the highest levels was similar to war in that it was about winning, almost at all costs, it is worth exploring the value that sporting contests have in the context of national defence.
