In the past year, the world has grappled with the COVID-19 pandemic – Singapore too was not spared. Amidst the challenging circumstances of the pandemic, Total Defence strengthened our resilience as a nation and a community, and showed how important it is for every one of us to take initiative and be involved. 
	
Moving forward, Singapore will continue to face different challenges. Hence, it is more important than ever for us to continue putting Total Defence into action. 
	Speakers may use the engagement package (Folio 1) to discuss the relevance of Total Defence and how each of us can play a part in keeping Singapore strong, amidst existing and future challenges.
