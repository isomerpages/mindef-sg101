<p>On 1 July each year, we commemorate SAF Day and reaffirm our loyalty and
commitment to the Singapore Armed Forces (SAF) and Singapore.</p>
<p>In this SAF Day 2025 Engagement Package, we highlight</p>
<p>(a) the importance of National Service (NS) and the SAF in defending Singapore;</p>
<p>(b) MINDEF/SAF's ongoing efforts to transform and build capabilities to
deal with the evolving security landscape; and</p>
<p>(c) Total Defence as the undergirding strength in uniting the SAF and
all Singaporeans in the defence of Singapore.</p>
