The theme for 2023's Total Defence campaign - "Together We Keep Singapore Strong" - focuses on the many ways we can put Total Defence into action in our everyday lives.

Total Defence remains relevant to deal with the ever-evolving threats and challenges to Singapore. These include misinformation, supply chain disruptions and food security that affect communities and Singaporeans' way of life.

Every Singaporean has a part to play in our daily lives to ensure that Singapore is prepared for crises or disruptions, and that we remain resilient and united.

Below are some resources on Total Defence which you may find useful for your engagement.
