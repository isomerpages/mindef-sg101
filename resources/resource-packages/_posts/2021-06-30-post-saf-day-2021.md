Annually on 1 July, SAF servicemen and women commemorate SAF Day and reaffirm our loyalty and commitment to the SAF and Singapore.

This year, we commemorate SAF Day amidst Singapore’s continued fight against the COVID-19 pandemic. In this SAF Day 2021 NE package prepared by Nexus, we cover (i) how our servicemen and women have responded to Singapore’s major crises including the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic, (ii) the SAF’s ongoing efforts to transform and better equip itself for the future, and (iii) the need for NS and a strong SAF.
You may use the engagement package (Folio 1) to discuss how the SAF keeps Singapore strong, amidst existing and future challenges.

Minister for Defence Dr Ng Eng Hen will also be sharing his SAF Day video message on his [Facebook page](https://www.facebook.com/ngenghen) on 30 Jun, 1800hrs.
