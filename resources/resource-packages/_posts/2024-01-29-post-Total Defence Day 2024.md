<p>2024 marks 40 years of Total Defence in Singapore, since it was first
introduced in 1984.</p>
<p>As we reflect on how Total Defence had rallied Singaporeans together to
address challenges in the past, we should also consider how we can all
play our part to put Total Defence into action and be ready for crises
and disruptions in the future.</p>
<p>The inaugural Exercise Singapore Ready will be conducted from 15 to 29
Feb 2024, simulating disruptions of power, water, food supply, digital
connectivity and civil emergency. Over 500 organisations from the private,
public and people sectors will be participating in this exercise. Some
SAF units and MINDEF departments are taking part too.</p>
