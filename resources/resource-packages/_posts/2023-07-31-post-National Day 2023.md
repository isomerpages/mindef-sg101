Every year on 9 August, we celebrate National Day and how far we've come since independence. It is also a day where we come together in a spirit of joy, unity and confidence to pledge how we, as Singaporeans, will continue to build a stronger Singapore.

You are encouraged to use the package to commemorate National Day and to discuss how we can continue to play a part in Singapore's future. Please download the package using the link below.
