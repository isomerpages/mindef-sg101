<p>Tensions in the Middle East have persisted since the attacks between Israel
and Hamas a year ago.&nbsp;</p>
<p>More recently, hostilities between Israel and Iran further heightened
tensions in the Middle East. The fight has since drawn in Iran-backed groups
such as the Lebanese armed group, Hezbollah.</p>
<p>Thousands of lives, including many women and children, have been killed
as a result of these conflicts.</p>
<p>To better understand the situation in the Middle East and Singapore’s
position, below are some useful resources for consideration.</p>
<p>Further updates will be made to this resource page as the situation continues
to develop.</p>
