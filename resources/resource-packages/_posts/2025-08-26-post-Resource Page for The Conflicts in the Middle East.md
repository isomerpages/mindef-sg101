<p>Tensions in the Middle East have persisted since the attacks between Israel
and Hamas in October 2023.</p>
<p>Hostilities between Israel and Iran further heightened tensions in the
Middle East since June 2025. The fight has since drawn in Iran-backed groups
such as the Lebanese armed group, Hezbollah.</p>
<p>Constant impediment of humanitarian aid has caused mass starvation and
a dire lack of essential medical services. The suffering of innocent civilians
is prolonged as a result of these conflicts.</p>
<p>To better understand the situation in the Middle East and Singapore’s
position, below are some useful resources for consideration.</p>
<p>Further updates will be made to this resource page as the situation continues
to develop.</p>
