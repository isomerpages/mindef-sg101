Annually on 1 July, SAF servicemen and women commemorate SAF Day and reaffirm our loyalty and commitment to the SAF and Singapore.

This year, we are also commemorating 55 years of National Service. In this SAF Day 2022 package prepared by Nexus, we cover the need for a strong defence in today’s increasing uncertain world, the SAF’s ongoing efforts to transform and build capabilities to deal with evolving threats and challenges and the need for NS for Singapore’s defence and security.

If the engagement session takes place in the afternoon of 1st July, you could refer to the MINDEF internet website and read out the Minister for Defence’s SAF Day message to your audience.

Note: There will **NOT** be any SAF Day video message by the Minister for Defence this year.
