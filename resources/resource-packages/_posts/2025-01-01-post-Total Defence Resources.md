<p>The theme for this year's Total Defence campaign - "Together We Keep Singapore
Strong" - focuses on Singaporeans' readiness for crises and disruptions,
and the many ways we can put Total Defence into action in our everyday
lives.</p>
<p>Total Defence remains relevant to deal with the ever-evolving hybrid threats
and challenges to Singapore. These include misinformation, supply chain
disruptions and food security that affect communities and Singaporeans'
way of life.</p>
<p>Every Singaporean has a part to play in our daily lives to ensure that
Singapore is prepared for crises or disruptions, and that we remain resilient
and united.</p>

<h4><strong>Exercise SG Ready</strong></h4>
<div class="isomer-image-wrapper">
<img style="width: 100%" height="auto" width="100%" alt="Exercise SG Ready" src="/images/Ex_SG_Ready_OOH_Posters.jpg">
</div>
<p>The inaugural Exercise SG Ready was held at various locations across the
island between 15 Feb to 29 Feb 2024 to <strong>increase Singaporeans' readiness for crises and disruptions</strong>.
The exercise simulated disruptions of power, water, food supply, digital
connectivity and a civil emergency arising from wide spread cyberattacks,
disinformation campaigns and drone attacks from an anonymous actor in the
region.</p>
<p>The aim of the exercise is to get individuals, communities and businesses
thinking about the question, <strong><em>"Are you ready for disruptions?",</em></strong> and
to put Total Defence into action by putting in place their own contingency
plans for disruptions.</p>
<div class="isomer-image-wrapper">
<img style="width: 100%" height="auto" width="100%" alt="" src="/images/29feb24_infographic2.jpg">
</div>
<p>More than 800 education, community, commercial, and government organisations,
participated in Exercise SG Ready. Participating organisations simulated
approximately 250 disruptions of power, 300 disruptions of food or water
supply, nearly 200 evacuation drills, and 200 cyber disruptions of which
10 or more were connectivity-related, and 20 or more were disinformation-related.</p>
<p>Students experienced lessons without fans or lights to simulate power
disruptions. To simulate food disruptions, some students got to try ready-to-eat
meals developed by the Singapore Food Agency and SATS, while others experienced
limitations to the range of food served in their canteens.</p>
<p>The PUB, Singapore's National Water Agency conducted a water supply disruption
at Yung Sheng Road where more than 200 households collected water from
PUB's water wagon and water bag filling machine. About 12,000 members of
the public visited the Civil Defence Shelter Open Houses at Dakota, Potong
Pasir, and Tan Kah Kee MRT stations to learn how selected underground MRT
stations can be converted into public shelters to protect civilians during
an emergency.</p>
<p>More than 160 businesses validated their contingency plans for either
simulated disruptions of power, water, food supply, digital connectivity
or a civil emergency. Some of them went on to conduct simulated phishing
exercises referencing Cyber Security Agency's playbooks, which were developed
in consultation with Microsoft and Google.</p>

<h4><strong>Total Defence Organisation Table-top Exercise (TTX)</strong></h4>
<p>The Total Defence Organisation TTX aims to activate thinking and encourage
discussion among participants on the strengths and weaknesses of their
organisation's existing Business Continuity Plan (BCP), and how their organisation

their BCP, ensuring organisations are well-prepared and resilient to navigate

<p>Are you game for something new? The Total Defence Tower Defence Game (TDTDG),
an online strategy game, was conceptualised and devised by a dynamic group
of youths from NUS High School of Mathematics and Science.</p>
<p>The game adds a Total Defence-themed twist to the classic tower defence
game where players need to allocate resources to build towers to defend
their territories against enemy attacks. In the TDTDG, players have to
defend Singapore against various threats. The threats have been designed
to showcase how the six pillars of Total Defence: Military, Civil, Economic,
Social, Digital and Psychological Defence, come into play and highlight
how everyone has a part to play in defending Singapore.</p>
<p>The TDTDG is the 4th ground-up initiative to be implemented under the
Total Defence Sandbox (TD Sandbox).</p>

<h4><strong>Useful Articles</strong></h4>
<p><strong>Commentary: The Spirit of Total Defence - by Mr Chew Sutat</strong>
</p>
<p>Crises and disruptions often have a disproportionate impact on the vulnerable.
During peacetime, we have to inculcate a culture of giving as a way of
living. To support and champion the potential of the differently-abled
in our midst. To commit not just resources in writing a cheque, but also
to volunteer our time and talent in the community. In establishing habits
that have been time-honoured since our forefathers' days of community self-help,
we can foster a whole-of-society resilience and not be easily shaken by
the next crisis.</p>

<p><strong>Sports and National Defence - a commentary written by Mr Nicholas Fang</strong>
</p>
<p>George Orwell famously wrote that sports is "war minus the shooting".
While the celebrated writer meant that sports at the highest levels was
similar to war in that it was about winning, almost at all costs, it is
worth exploring the value that sporting contests have in the context of
national defence.</p>
