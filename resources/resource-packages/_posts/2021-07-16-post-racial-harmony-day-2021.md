21 July 1964 was the day that the first of a series of race riots between Chinese and Malay groups took place in Singapore. The riots started during a Malay procession marking the birthday of Prophet Muhammad, and spread over July and September. It resulted in 36 deaths and 560 injured.
 
Recently, incidents relating to racial discrimination and insensitivity have been making headlines. Our leaders and many Singaporeans have spoken up against such acts.
 
This yearâ€™s Racial Harmony Day is a timely reminder on how we should not let racial differences divide us, and how we should instead turn diversity into strength to work towards a stronger, multi-racial Singapore.
 
You are encouraged to use this package (Folio 1) to discuss the importance of racial harmony in Singapore. We have also included a PDF version (Folio 2) that you may forward to your respective departments and teams.
