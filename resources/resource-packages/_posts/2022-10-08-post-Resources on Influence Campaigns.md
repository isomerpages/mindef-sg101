**Introduction to understanding why sovereignty matters to small states**. 
"If they are bigger, we have to do what they say, right?" "What chance do we have when we are small?" In a world that is increasingly chaotic, how do small countries survive or even thrive? How should we see ourselves as we face the interests of larger countries? Bilahari Kausikan shares his thoughts on how Singapore can find her place in the world. He is Singapore's former Ambassador to Russia and Finland. He also served as Singapore's Permanent Representative to the United Nations.

**Introduction to understanding what influence campaigns are and the impact on a country and its society**. Every nation must make their own choices to determine their destiny. How will these choices play out on the world stage? Countries may align their interests, come to a conflict or even seek to influence one another. Bilahari Kausikan shares his thoughts on what happens when larger nations seek to change what we want for ourselves.
