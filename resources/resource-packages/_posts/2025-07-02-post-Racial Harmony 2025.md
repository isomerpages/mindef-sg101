<p>This year, Singapore celebrates 60 years of unity. While we stand as an
exemplar of racial and religious harmony in an increasingly divided world,
we must remember that every one plays a part in building a caring and inclusive
society.</p>
<p></p>
<p>You are encouraged to use this package to have conversations around the
importance of racial and religious harmony in Singapore, and how we can
all foster understanding and build a more united Singapore.&nbsp;</p>
