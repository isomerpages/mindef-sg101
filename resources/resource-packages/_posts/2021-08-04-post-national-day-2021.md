The National Day Parade (NDP) is a cherished tradition, which has been held annually since 1966 to mark Singapore’s independence. It is a testament to our determination to shine, and how we have forged our own way against the odds. 
 
Even in difficult times, Singaporeans come together every year on 9 Aug to celebrate who we are, how far we’ve come, and look forward to the road ahead. Amidst COVID-19, we have found new ways to mark National Day and bring NDP to the nation. This year, a ceremonial parade will be held on 9 Aug, while NDP will be held on 21 Aug.
 
This year’s National Day Engagement Package consists of slides for engagement (Folio 1) as well as a supplementary film package (Folio 2). Facilitators are encouraged to use this Engagement Package (Folios 1 & 2) for engagement sessions to reflect on Singapore’s independence, what it means to be Singaporean, and the meaning of the Singapore spirit.
