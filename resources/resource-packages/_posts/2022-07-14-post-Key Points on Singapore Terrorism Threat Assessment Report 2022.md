## Overview 

<div style="border:0px solid #0505f8;background-color:#f8f8f8;padding:1.2em;">
<p>
•	 The Singapore Terrorism Threat Assessment Report (STTAR) 2022 was issued by the Internal Security Department on 13 Jul. 
<br>
•	 This page covers the key points from the report, and what it found about Singapore's terrorism threat landscape. </p></div> 


## Key Points

(1) The terrorism threat to Singapore remains high.&nbsp; Whilst there is currently no specific intelligence of an imminent terrorist attack, Singapore continues to feature as a target on terrorist propaganda.&nbsp;<br>

(2) With the relaxation of pandemic restrictions and resumption of cross-border travel, terrorist elements may become more active and revisit plots that had been put on hold.&nbsp;<br>

(3) The threat from Islamist terrorist groups and their violent ideology persists.&nbsp; Their virtual network of supporters continues to disseminate propaganda, raise funds and plot attacks.<br>

(4) The spread of radical ideologies online has fuelled the self-radicalisation threat in Singapore.&nbsp;<br>

(5) Ongoing developments abroad, such as in the Middle East, Afghanistan and Ukraine, could also affect our security landscape.&nbsp; Extremist elements can exploit such conflicts and tap on grievances to promote their radical narratives and recruit supporters.&nbsp;<br>

(6) It is important to maintain a zero-tolerance approach to all forms of hate speech and extremist rhetoric.<br>

(7) The SGSecure movement is a way for the community to come together to fight terrorism and protect Singapore and our way of life.&nbsp;Public vigilance and preparedness are key components of our defence against terrorism. <br>
