The theme for 2023's Total Defence campaign - "Together We Keep Singapore Strong" - focuses on the many ways we can put Total Defence into action in our everyday lives.

Total Defence remains relevant to deal with the ever-evolving threats and challenges to Singapore. These include misinformation, supply chain disruptions and food security that affect communities and Singaporeans' way of life.

Every Singaporean has a part to play in our daily lives to ensure that Singapore is prepared for crises or disruptions, and that we remain resilient and united.

Below are some resources on Total Defence which you may find useful for your engagement.

The Total Defence Sandbox invites everyone to share ideas on Total Defence and aims to nurture these ideas and eventually match ideas with partners who could support the implementation or amplification of their efforts.

Are you game for something new? The Total Defence Tower Defence Game (TDTDG), an online strategy game, was conceptualised and devised by a dynamic group of youths from NUS High School of Mathematics and Science. 

The game adds a Total Defence-themed twist to the classic tower defence game where players need to allocate resources to build towers to defend their territories against enemy attacks. In the TDTDG, players have to defend Singapore against various threats. The threats have been designed to showcase how the six pillars of Total Defence: Military, Civil, Economic, Social, Digital and Psychological Defence, come into play and highlight how everyone has a part to play in defending Singapore. 

The TDTDG is the 4th ground-up initiative to be implemented under the Total Defence Sandbox (TD Sandbox).

**Sports and National Defence - a commentary written by Mr Nicholas Fang**

George Orwell famously wrote that sports is "war minus the shooting". While the celebrated writer meant that sports at the highest levels was similar to war in that it was about winning, almost at all costs, it is worth exploring the value that sporting contests have in the context of national defence.
