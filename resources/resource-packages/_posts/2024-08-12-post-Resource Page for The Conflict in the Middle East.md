On 7 Oct 2023, Hamas launched a coordinated surprise offensive on Israel via land, air and sea, resulting in the deaths of more than 1,100 Israelis, mostly civilians, and taking over 200 hostages. 

Israel's resulting invasion of Gaza has since claimed over 30,000 Gazan lives, including women and children, according to the health ministry in the Hamas-controlled territory.

To better understand the situation in the Middle East and Singapore’s position, below are some useful resources for consideration.

Further updates will be made to this resource page as the situation continues to develop.
