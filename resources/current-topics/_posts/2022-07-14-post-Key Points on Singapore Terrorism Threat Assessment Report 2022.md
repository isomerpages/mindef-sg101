## Key Points

(1) The terrorism threat to Singapore remains high.  Whilst there is currently no specific intelligence of an imminent terrorist attack, Singapore continues to feature as a target on terrorist propaganda. <br>

(2) With the relaxation of pandemic restrictions and resumption of cross-border travel, terrorist elements may become more active and revisit plots that had been put on hold. <br>

(3) The threat from Islamist terrorist groups and their violent ideology persists.  Their virtual network of supporters continues to disseminate propaganda, raise funds and plot attacks.<br>

(4) The spread of radical ideologies online has fuelled the self-radicalisation threat in Singapore. <br>

(5) Ongoing developments abroad, such as in the Middle East, Afghanistan and Ukraine, could also affect our security landscape.  Extremist elements can exploit such conflicts and tap on grievances to promote their radical narratives and recruit supporters. <br>

(6) It is important to maintain a zero-tolerance approach to all forms of hate speech and extremist rhetoric.<br>

(7) The SGSecure movement is a way for the community to come together to fight terrorism and protect Singapore and our way of life. Public vigilance and preparedness are key components of our defence against terrorism. <br>
