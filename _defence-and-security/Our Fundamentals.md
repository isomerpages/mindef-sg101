#### Build Our Own Defence

Singapore has several vulnerabilities. We are small in size and have no hinterland to fall back on if we are attacked. As an open economy, we are sensitive to world-wide disturbances such as global economic shocks and pandemics. As a multi-cultural and diverse society, we have potential fault lines that can be exploited. Therefore, we need a strong and credible defence force to protect our sovereignty and our national interests, and a united society that stays together to ensure Total Defence.

#### Safeguard Our Air and Sea Lines of Communication

As a small country with no natural resources, we are dependent on free trade and open markets around the world for our daily essentials, economic growth and survival. We therefore have a strong interest in ensuring our air and sea lanes remain open and safe, so that ships and aircraft can move freely into and from Singapore. 

#### Uphold an Open and Inclusive Regional Security Architecture Underpinned by International Law

A stable and peaceful regional environment, based on a rules-based order, is essential for Singapore’s survival, security and progress. Imagine an alternate international order where “might is right”, small states like Singapore would have little chance of survival. With an increasingly complex security landscape and geopolitical environment, a rules-based order enables countries to manage diplomatic relations and peacefully settle disputes based on agreed principles.

#### Secure Our Way of Life and Values

Multi-culturalism, meritocracy and self-determination are some values that underpin our national identity. With evolving security and hybrid threats on the horizon, it is important to secure our society’s cohesion and unity. This is because hybrid threats are subtle and go beyond the physical domain, target hearts and minds, and are aimed at breaking our social unity and resilience. It takes more than the efforts of security agencies to deal with these new challenges. Regardless of race or religion, all of us must play a part to keep Singapore strong by being aware of the threats, being more understanding of differences among us, and looking out for one another.
