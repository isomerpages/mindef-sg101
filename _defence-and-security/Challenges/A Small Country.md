As a small island city-state without a hinterland and surrounded by large neighbours in a culturally diverse region, our independence, survival and growth are always at risk.  We are dependent on external sources for our essential needs, like food and water. Hence, freedom of navigation and unimpeded access to air and sea lines of communication is critical to sustain our supply chains and maintain Singapore’s economic vibrancy.  

We support the international rule of law which protects the interests of small countries like Singapore by upholding the equal rights and sovereignty of all states regardless of size. But there is no guarantee that international law will prevent others from acting aggressively. Having a strong defence force will help to deter external aggression, defend our sovereignty, and provide us with the political space and freedom to act in our national and strategic interests. Singapore’s small size also means that the Singapore Armed Forces (SAF) has limited training space within our territory. Therefore, overseas training is integral for the SAF.
