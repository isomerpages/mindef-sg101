The late-1990s was a difficult time for Singapore. Our economy was still struggling after the Asian Financial Crisis, and global outlook was grim. Moreover, the Doha Talks by the World Trade Organisation (WTO) had stalled. 

Faced with dim prospects, Singapore decided that it had to chart its own economic future by pushing for free trade agreements with its key trading partners, said former Prime Minister Goh Chok Tong in 2014.

Singapore had an ambitious plan to signal its intention -- seal an FTA with the world’s largest economy, the United States. However, Singapore’s relationship with the White House was at a low point at the time.

The US-Singapore FTA was officially signed in 2003 and implemented a year later. It was the first FTA signed between the US and an East Asian nation. The FTA removes tariffs and allows for better movement of goods between the two nations.
