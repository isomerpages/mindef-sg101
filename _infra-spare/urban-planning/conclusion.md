#### Conclusion

Building a home is more than erecting four walls, constructing a roof and laying out a floor. A home is filled with people, memories and a space that evokes a sense of place.

With some planning, a dose of imagination and a firm commitment to carry through our plans, we hope our tiny island can continue to be a home that we will all enjoy and love for ourselves and future generations of Singaporeans.
