### What is the Total Defence Sandbox?

### What ideas can I submit?
**We are looking for ideas that put Total Defence into action and targets the issue statement below.**

***Note*** : The idea need not solely target the issue stated and we are open to all ideas that will put Total Defence in action. If you have additional ideas, please do submit them. 

An example is as follows:

**Issue:  Hybrid Threats and Emerging Challenges in Singapore**

The nature of threats is constantly evolving. Other than traditional security threats (e.g., territorial tensions, terrorism and piracy), there are emerging ones where Singapore’s vulnerabilities could be easily exploited without the need for military conflict (e.g., cyberattacks, misinformation and fake news – social media and digital platforms being major channels of influence where there are no boundaries). 

**Start an initiative which could help educate youths and the community on the evolving threats and navigate the complex environment that Singapore operates in.** This could be done through the creation of content / an initiative / a campaign / a product that supports Total Defence.  Should you have other ideas that do not solely target the issue stated, please do submit them as we are open to all ideas that will put Total Defence in action. Some possible examples include:
-	Strengthening Economic Defence through Resource Sustainability (e.g. Food, Water and Energy)
-	Climate Change and its effect on Singapore
