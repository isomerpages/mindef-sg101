## National Education Resources

#### [Total Defence Resources](https://www.mindef.gov.sg/oms/imindef/mindef_websites/topics/totaldefence/resources.html)

"Total Defence" explains how every Singaporean plays a part and comes together to keep Singapore strong and resilient against all kinds of challenges and threats. Every year, we reach out to the public to help them understand what Total Defence is and what they can do to help strengthen our defence against these challenges and threats.

#### [News in Focus](https://www.mindef.gov.sg/oms/nexus/news-in-focus.html)

News in Focus is a short e-bulletin summarising relevant media reports on recent events that have possible lessons and implications for Singapore. This bulletin is sent to our key partners via email. If you would like to be added to the mailing list, please write to us at nexus@defence.gov.sg.

#### [National Education Resource Packages](https://www.mindef.gov.sg/oms/nexus/ne-resource-packages.html)

Nexus develops resource packages on "NE moments" that are of interest to Singapore or may have security implications for us. For example, cyber attacks or terrorist attacks.

#### [Oral History Recordings](https://www.mindef.gov.sg/oms/nexus/oral-history-recordings.html) 

SAF veterans/NSmen recount their experiences in historical events in Singapore (e.g., Japanese Occupation and 1964 Racial Riots) and the SAF (e.g., early days of the SAF, Humanitarian Assistance and Disaster Relief Operations). Their experiences can help the young understand challenges and adversity, fear and courage, disappointment and hope, determination and resourcefulness - the stuff that Singaporeans are made of.
